			</hgroup>
			<p>As I sit down to write here amidst the shadows of vine-leaves under t=
he blue sky of southern Italy, it comes to me with a certain quality of ast=
onishment that my participation in these amazing adventures of <abbr epub:t="ype=3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Cavor was, after all, the outcome =
of the purest accident. It might have been anyone. I fell into these things=
 at a time when I thought myself removed from the slightest possibility of =
disturbing experiences. I had gone to Lympne because I had imagined it the =
most uneventful place in the world. =E2=80=9CHere, at any rate,=E2=80=9D sa=
id I, =E2=80=9CI shall find peace and a chance to work!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>And this book is the sequel. So utterly at variance is Destiny with a=
ll the little plans of men.</p>
			<p>I may perhaps mention here that very recently I had come an ugly crop=
per in certain business enterprises. Sitting now surrounded by all the circ=
umstances of wealth, there is a luxury in admitting my extremity. I can adm=
it, even, that to a certain extent my disasters were conceivably of my own =
making. It may be there are directions in which I have some capacity, but t=
he conduct of business operations is not among these. But in those days I w=
as young, and my youth among other objectionable forms took that of a pride=
 in my capacity for affairs. I am young still in years, but the things that=
 have happened to me have rubbed something of the youth from my mind. Wheth=
er they have brought any wisdom to light below it is a more doubtful matter=
.</p>
			<p>It is scarcely necessary to go into the details of the speculations t=
hat landed me at Lympne, in Kent. Nowadays even about business transactions=
 there is a strong spice of adventure. I took risks. In these things there =
is invariably a certain amount of give and take, and it fell to me finally =
to do the giving. Reluctantly enough. Even when I had got out of everything=
, one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be malignant. Perhaps you have met t=
hat flaming sense of outraged virtue, or perhaps you have only felt it. He =
ran me hard. It seemed to me, at last, that there was nothing for it but to=
 write a play, unless I wanted to drudge for my living as a clerk. I have a=
 certain imagination, and luxurious tastes, and I meant to make a vigorous =
fight for it before that fate overtook me. In addition to my belief in my p=
owers as a business man, I had always in those days had an idea that I was =
equal to writing a very good play. It is not, I believe, a very uncommon pe=
rsuasion. I knew there is nothing a man can do outside legitimate business =
transactions that has such opulent possibilities, and very probably that bi=
ased my opinion. I had, indeed, got into the habit of regarding this unwrit=
ten drama as a convenient little reserve put by for a rainy day. That rainy=
 day had come and I set to work.</p>
			<p>I soon discovered that writing a play was a longer business than I ha=
d supposed; at first I had reckoned ten days for it, and it was to have a p=
ied-=C3=A0-terre while it was in hand that I came to Lympne. I reckoned mys=
elf lucky in getting that little bungalow. I got it on a three years=E2=80=
=99 agreement. I put in a few sticks of furniture, and while the play was i=
n hand I did my own cooking. My cooking would have shocked <abbr epub:type="=3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mrs.</abbr>=C2=A0Bond. And yet, you know, it had flav=
our. I had a coffeepot, a saucepan for eggs, and one for potatoes, and a fr=
ying-pan for sausages and bacon=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94such was the simple appara=
tus of my comfort. One cannot always be magnificent, but simplicity is alwa=
ys a possible alternative. For the rest I laid in an eighteen-gallon cask o=
f beer on credit, and a trustful baker came each day. It was not, perhaps, =
in the style of Sybaris, but I have had worse times. I was a little sorry f=
or the baker, who was a very decent man indeed, but even for him I hoped.<!--

			</p><p>Certainly if anyone wants solitude, the place is Lympne. It is in the=
 clay part of Kent, and my bungalow stood on the edge of an old sea cliff a=
nd stared across the flats of Romney Marsh at the sea. In very wet weather =
the place is almost inaccessible, and I have heard that at times the postma=
n used to traverse the more succulent portions of his route with boards upo=
n his feet. I never saw him doing so, but I can quite imagine it. Outside t=
he doors of the few cottages and houses that make up the present village bi=
g birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the worst of the clay, which will giv=
e some idea of the texture of the district. I doubt if the place would be t=
here at all, if it were not a fading memory of things gone forever. It was =
the big port of England in Roman times, Portus Lemanus, and now the sea is =
four miles away. All down the steep hill are boulders and masses of Roman b=
rickwork, and from it old Watling Street, still paved in places, starts lik=
e an arrow to the north. I used to stand on the hill and think of it all, t=
he galleys and legions, the captives and officials, the women and traders, =
the speculators like myself, all the swarm and tumult that came clanking in=
 and out of the harbour. And now just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slo=
pe, and a sheep or two=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and me! And where the port had been=
 were the levels of the marsh, sweeping round in a broad curve to distant D=
ungeness, and dotted here and there with tree clumps and the church towers =
of old medieval towns that are following Lemanus now towards extinction.
			</p><p>That outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one of the finest views I have=
 ever seen. I suppose Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a raft =
on the sea, and further westward were the hills by Hastings under the setti=
ng sun. Sometimes they hung close and clear, sometimes they were faded and =
low, and often the drift of the weather took them clean out of sight. And a=
ll the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit by ditches and canals.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>The window at which I worked looked over the skyline of this crest, a=
nd it was from this window that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as I=
 was struggling with my scenario, holding down my mind to the sheer hard wo=
rk of it, and naturally enough he arrested my attention.</p>
			<p>The sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity of green and yellow=
, and against that he came out black=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the oddest little fig=
ure.</p>
			<p>He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little man, with a jerky qu=
ality in his motions; he had seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a=
 cricket cap, an overcoat, and cycling knickerbockers and stockings. Why he=
 did so I do not know, for he never cycled and he never played cricket. It =
was a fortuitous concurrence of garments, arising I know not how. He gestic=
ulated with his hands and arms, and jerked his head about and <em>buzzed. He buzzed like something electric. You never heard such buzzing. And ev=
er and again he cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise.</em></p><em>
			<p>There had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of his was enhanced by t=
he extreme slipperiness of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the sun=
 he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then with a sort of convulsive =
gesture he turned and retreated with every manifestation of haste, no longe=
r gesticulating, but going with ample strides that showed the relatively la=
rge size of his feet=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94they were, I remember, grotesquely ex=
aggerated in size by adhesive clay=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94to the best possible ad=
vantage.</p>
			<p>This occurred on the first day of my sojourn, when my play-writing en=
ergy was at its height, and I regarded the incident simply as an annoying d=
istraction=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the waste of five minutes. I returned to my sce=
nario. But when next evening the apparition was repeated with remarkable pr=
ecision, and again the next evening, and indeed every evening when rain was=
 not falling, concentration upon the scenario became a considerable effort.=
 =E2=80=9CConfound the man,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cone would think he wa=
s learning to be a marionette!=E2=80=9D and for several evenings I cursed h=
im pretty heartily.</p>
			<p>Then my annoyance gave way to amazement and curiosity. Why on earth s=
hould a man do this thing? On the fourteenth evening I could stand it no lo=
nger, and so soon as he appeared I opened the French window, crossed the ve=
randah, and directed myself to the point where he invariably stopped.</p>
			<p>He had his watch out as I came up to him. He had a chubby, rubicund f=
ace with reddish brown eyes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94previously I had seen him only=
 against the light. =E2=80=9COne moment, sir,=E2=80=9D said I as he turned.=
</p>
			<p>He stared. =E2=80=9COne moment,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Ccertainly.=
 Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it is not asking too much=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94your moment is up=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94would it trouble you to a=
ccompany me?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNot in the least,=E2=80=9D said I, placing myself beside him=
.</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, I enjoy the sunlight=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the atmosphere=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I go along this path, through that gate=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=

			<p>=E2=80=9COh! tonight! Let me see. Ah! I just glanced at my watch, saw=
 that I had already been out just three minutes over the precise half-hour,=
 decided there was not time to go round, turned=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D&lt;=

=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhy, this!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThis?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes. Why do you do it? Every night you come making a noise=

			<p>=E2=80=9CLike this=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I imitated his buzzing n=
oise.</p>
			<p>He looked at me, and it was evident the buzzing awakened distaste. =
=E2=80=9CDo I do <em>that</em>?=E2=80=9D he asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CEvery blessed evening.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI had no idea.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. =E2=80=9CCan it be,=E2=80=9D=
 he said, =E2=80=9Cthat I have formed a Habit?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, it looks like it. Doesn=E2=80=99t it?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He pulled down his lower lip between finger and thumb. He regarded a =
puddle at his feet.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy mind is much occupied,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CAnd you=
 want to know <em>why</em>! Well, sir, I can assure you that not only do I =
not know why I do these things, but I did not even know I did them. Come to=
 think, it is just as you say; I never <em>have</em> been beyond that field=
.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 And these things annoy you?=E2=80=9D&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p></em><p><em>For some reason I was beginning to relent towards him. =E2=80=9CNot &lt;=

			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, anything that needs concentration.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAh!=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cof course,=E2=80=9D and medit=
ated. His expression became so eloquent of distress, that I relented still =
more. After all, there <em>is</em> a touch of aggression in demanding of a =
man you don=E2=80=99t know why he hums on a public footpath.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou see,=E2=80=9D he said weakly, =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s a ha=

			<p>=E2=80=9CNot at all, sir,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cnot at all. I am=
 greatly indebted to you. I should guard myself against these things. In fu=
ture I will. Could I trouble you=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94once again? That noise?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSomething like this,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9C<i>Zuzzoo, zu=
zzoo.</i> But really, you know=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI am greatly obliged to you. In fact, I know I am getting ab=
surdly absentminded. You are quite justified, sir=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94perfectl=

			<p>=E2=80=9CI do hope my impertinence=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNot at all, sir, not at all.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We regarded each other for a moment. I raised my hat and wished him a=
 good evening. He responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.</p>
			<p>At the stile I looked back at his receding figure. His bearing had ch=
anged remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast with his former ge=
sticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as pathetic. I watche=
d him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own busines=
s, I returned to my bungalow and my play.</p>
			<p>The next evening I saw nothing of him, nor the next. But he was very =
much in my mind, and it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic char=
acter he might serve a useful purpose in the development of my plot. The th=
ird day he called upon me.</p>
			<p>For a time I was puzzled to think what had brought him. He made indif=
ferent conversation in the most formal way, then abruptly he came to busine=
ss. He wanted to buy me out of my bungalow.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou see,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t blame yo=
u in the least, but you=E2=80=99ve destroyed a habit, and it disorganises m=
y day. I=E2=80=99ve walked past here for years=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94years. No d=

e made all that impossible!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I suggested he might try some other direction.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo. There is no other direction. This is the only one. I=E2=
=80=99ve inquired. And now=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94every afternoon at four=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94I come to a dead wall.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut, my dear sir, if the thing is so important to you=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s vital. You see, I=E2=80=99m=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I=

search. I live=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D he paused and seemed to think. =
=E2=80=9CJust over there,=E2=80=9D he said, and pointed suddenly dangerousl=
y near my eye. =E2=80=9CThe house with white chimneys you see just over the=
 trees. And my circumstances are abnormal=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94abnormal. I am o=
n the point of completing one of the most important demonstrations=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=94I can assure you one of <em>the most important</em> demonstrations=
 that have ever been made. It requires constant thought, constant mental ea=
se and activity. And the afternoon was my brightest time!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=
effervescing with new ideas=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94new points of view.=E2=80=9D<!--
p-->
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CBut why not come by still?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt would be all different. I should be self-conscious. I sho=
uld think of you at your play=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94watching me irritated=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94instead of thinking of my work. No! I must have the bungalow.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the matter over thoroughly =
before anything decisive was said. I was generally ready enough for busines=
s in those days, and selling always attracted me; but in the first place it=
 was not my bungalow, and even if I sold it to him at a good price I might =
get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods if the current owner got wind o=
f the transaction, and in the second I was, well=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94undischar=
ged. It was clearly a business that required delicate handling. Moreover, t=
he possibility of his being in pursuit of some valuable invention also inte=
rested me. It occurred to me that I would like to know more of this researc=
h, not with any dishonest intention, but simply with an idea that to know w=
hat it was would be a relief from play-writing. I threw out feelers.</p>
			<p>He was quite willing to supply information. Indeed, once he was fairl=
y under way the conversation became a monologue. He talked like a man long =
pent up, who has had it over with himself again and again. He talked for ne=
arly an hour, and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff bit of listening=
. But through it all there was the undertone of satisfaction one feels when=
 one is neglecting work one has set oneself. During that first interview I =
gathered very little of the drift of his work. Half his words were technica=
lities entirely strange to me, and he illustrated one or two points with wh=
at he was pleased to call elementary mathematics, computing on an envelope =
with a copying-ink pencil, in a manner that made it hard even to seem to un=
derstand. =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D I said; =E2=80=9Cyes. Go on!=E2=80=9D Neve=
rtheless I made out enough to convince me that he was no mere crank playing=
 at discoveries. In spite of his crank-like appearance there was a force ab=
out him that made that impossible. Whatever it was, it was a thing with mec=
hanical possibilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and of three assis=
tants=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94originally jobbing carpenters=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94whom =
he had trained. Now, from the work-shed to the patent office is clearly onl=
y one step. He invited me to see those things. I accepted readily, and took=
 care, by a remark or so, to underline that. The proposed transfer of the b=
ungalow remained very conveniently in suspense.</p>
			<p>At last he rose to depart, with an apology for the length of his call=
. Talking over his work was, he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely. I=
t was not often he found such an intelligent listener as myself, he mingled=
 very little with professional scientific men.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSo much pettiness,=E2=80=9D he explained; =E2=80=9Cso much i=
ntrigue! And really, when one has an idea=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a novel, fertili=
sing idea=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I don=E2=80=99t want to be uncharitable, but=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I am a man who believes in impulses. I made what was perhaps a rash p=
roposition. But you must remember that I had been alone, play-writing in Ly=
mpne, for fourteen days, and my compunction for his ruined walk still hung =
about me. =E2=80=9CWhy not,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cmake this your new ha=
bit? In the place of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can settle about =
the bungalow. What you want is to turn over your work in your mind. That yo=
u have always done during your afternoon walk. Unfortunately that=E2=80=99s=
 over=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94you can=E2=80=99t get things back as they were. But =
why not come and talk about your work to me; use me as a sort of wall again=

=94and I know no scientific men=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I stopped. He was considering. Evidently the thing attracted him. =E2=
=80=9CBut I=E2=80=99m afraid I should bore you,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CBut really can you spare the time?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThere is no rest like change of occupation,=E2=80=9D I said,=
 with profound conviction.</p>
			<p>The affair was over. On my verandah steps he turned. =E2=80=9CI am al=
ready greatly indebted to you,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>I made an interrogative noise.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou have completely cured me of that ridiculous habit of hum=
ming,=E2=80=9D he explained.</p>
			<p>I think I said I was glad to be of any service to him, and he turned =
away.</p>
			<p>Immediately the train of thought that our conversation had suggested =
must have resumed its sway. His arms began to wave in their former fashion.=
 The faint echo of =E2=80=9C<i>zuzzoo</i>=E2=80=9D came back to me on the b=
reeze.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>Well, after all, that was not my affair.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>He came the next day, and again the next day after that, and delivere=
d two lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an air=
 of being extremely lucid about the =E2=80=9Cether,=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ct=
ubes of force,=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cgravitational potential,=E2=80=9D and =
things like that, and I sat in my other folding-chair and said, =E2=80=9CYe=
s,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CGo on,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CI follow you,=E2=80=9D to kee=
p him going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he eve=
r suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I do=
ubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from that =
confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a space, onl=
y to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention =
failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at him, wonderi=
ng whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a central figur=
e in a good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And then, perhaps, I =
would catch on again for a bit.</p>
			<p>At the earliest opportunity I went to see his house. It was large and=
 carelessly furnished; there were no servants other than his three assistan=
ts, and his dietary and private life were characterised by a philosophical =
simplicity. He was a water-drinker, a vegetarian, and all those logical dis=
ciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment settled many doubts. It lo=
oked like business from cellar to attic=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94an amazing little =
place to find in an out-of-the-way village. The ground-floor rooms containe=
d benches and apparatus, the bakehouse and scullery boiler had developed in=
to respectable furnaces, dynamos occupied the cellar, and there was a gasom=
eter in the garden. He showed it to me with all the confiding zest of a man=
 who has been living too much alone. His seclusion was overflowing now in a=
n excess of confidence, and I had the good luck to be the recipient.</p>
			<p>The three assistants were creditable specimens of the class of =E2=80=
=9Chandymen=E2=80=9D from which they came. Conscientious if unintelligent, =
strong, civil, and willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and all the m=
etal work, had been a sailor; a second, Gibbs, was a joiner; and the third =
was an ex-jobbing gardener, and now general assistant. They were the merest=
 labourers. All the intelligent work was done by Cavor. Theirs was the dark=
est ignorance compared even with my muddled impression.</p>
			<p>And now, as to the nature of these inquiries. Here, unhappily, comes =
a grave difficulty. I am no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt to =
set forth in the highly scientific language of <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:nam=" e-title"="">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Cavor the aim to which his experiments tended, I a=
m afraid I should confuse not only the reader but myself, and almost certai=
nly I should make some blunder that would bring upon me the mockery of ever=
y up-to-date student of mathematical physics in the country. The best thing=
 I can do therefore is, I think, to give my impressions in my own inexact l=
anguage, without any attempt to wear a garment of knowledge to which I have=
 no claim.</p>
			<p>The object of <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Ca=
vor=E2=80=99s search was a substance that should be =E2=80=9Copaque=E2=80=
=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94he used some other word I have forgotten, but =E2=80=
=9Copaque=E2=80=9D conveys the idea=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94to =E2=80=9Call forms =
of radiant energy.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CRadiant energy,=E2=80=9D he made me un=
derstand, was anything like light or heat, or those R=C3=B6ntgen Rays there=
 was so much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric waves of Marconi,=
 or gravitation. All these things, he said, <em>radiate</em> out from centr=
es, and act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term =E2=80=9Cradiant=
 energy.=E2=80=9D Now almost all substances are opaque to some form or othe=
r of radiant energy. Glass, for example, is transparent to light, but much =
less so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and alum is transpa=
rent to light, but blocks heat completely. A solution of iodine in carbon b=
isulphide, on the other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transpa=
rent to heat. It will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to re=
ach you. Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electric=
al energy, which passes through both iodine solution and glass almost as th=
ough they were not interposed. And so on.</p>
			<p>Now all known substances are =E2=80=9Ctransparent=E2=80=9D to gravita=
tion. You can use screens of various sorts to cut off the light or heat, or=
 electrical influence of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from anything;=
 you can screen things by sheets of metal from Marconi=E2=80=99s rays, but =
nothing will cut off the gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravita=
tional attraction of the earth. Yet why there should be nothing is hard to =
say. Cavor did not see why such a substance should not exist, and certainly=
 I could not tell him. I had never thought of such a possibility before. He=
 showed me by calculations on paper, which Lord Kelvin, no doubt, or Profes=
sor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or any of those great scientific peop=
le might have understood, but which simply reduced me to a hopeless muddle,=
 that not only was such a substance possible, but that it must satisfy cert=
ain conditions. It was an amazing piece of reasoning. Much as it amazed and=
 exercised me at the time, it would be impossible to reproduce it here. =E2=
=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D I said to it all, =E2=80=9Cyes; go on!=E2=80=9D Suffice=
 it for this story that he believed he might be able to manufacture this po=
ssible substance opaque to gravitation out of a complicated alloy of metals=
 and something new=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a new element, I fancy=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94called, I believe, <em>helium</em>, which was sent to him from London in=
 sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown upon this detail, but I am almost=
 certain it was <em>helium</em> he had sent him in sealed stone jars. It wa=
s certainly something very gaseous and thin. If only I had taken notes.=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>But then, how was I to foresee the necessity of taking notes?</p>
			<p>Anyone with the merest germ of an imagination will understand the ext=
raordinary possibilities of such a substance, and will sympathise a little =
with the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged from the haze of abst=
ruse phrases in which Cavor expressed himself. Comic relief in a play indee=
d! It was some time before I would believe that I had interpreted him arigh=
t, and I was very careful not to ask questions that would have enabled him =
to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into which he dropped his daily=
 exposition. But no one reading the story of it here will sympathise fully,=
 because from my barren narrative it will be impossible to gather the stren=
gth of my conviction that this astonishing substance was positively going t=
o be made.</p>
			<p>I do not recall that I gave my play an hour=E2=80=99s consecutive wor=
k at any time after my visit to his house. My imagination had other things =
to do. There seemed no limit to the possibilities of the stuff; whichever w=
ay I tried I came on miracles and revolutions. For example, if one wanted t=
o lift a weight, however enormous, one had only to get a sheet of this subs=
tance beneath it, and one might lift it with a straw. My first natural impu=
lse was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads, and all the material=
 and methods of war, and from that to shipping, locomotion, building, every=
 conceivable form of human industry. The chance that had brought me into th=
e very birth-chamber of this new time=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it was an epoch, no =
less=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94was one of those chances that come once in a thousand=
 years. The thing unrolled, it expanded and expanded. Among other things I =
saw in it my redemption as a business man. I saw a parent company, and daug=
hter companies, applications to right of us, applications to left, rings an=
d trusts, privileges and concessions spreading and spreading, until one vas=
t, stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the world.</p>
			<p>And I was in it!</p>
			<p>I took my line straight away. I knew I was staking everything, but I =
jumped there and then.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re on absolutely the biggest thing that has ever =
been invented,=E2=80=9D I said, and put the accent on =E2=80=9Cwe.=E2=80=9D=
 =E2=80=9CIf you want to keep me out of this, you=E2=80=99ll have to do it =
with a gun. I=E2=80=99m coming down to be your fourth labourer tomorrow.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>He seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not a bit suspicious or hos=
tile. Rather, he was self-depreciatory.</p>
			<p>He looked at me doubtfully. =E2=80=9CBut do you really think=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=94?=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CAnd your play! How about that play?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s vanished!=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=9CMy dear si=
r, don=E2=80=99t you see what you=E2=80=99ve got? Don=E2=80=99t you see wha=
t you=E2=80=99re going to do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>That was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively, he didn=E2=80=99t.=
 At first I could not believe it. He had not had the beginning of the inkli=
ng of an idea. This astonishing little man had been working on purely theor=
etical grounds the whole time! When he said it was =E2=80=9Cthe most import=
ant=E2=80=9D research the world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared u=
p so many theories, settled so much that was in doubt; he had troubled no m=
ore about the application of the stuff he was going to turn out than if he =
had been a machine that makes guns. This was a possible substance, and he w=
as going to make it! <i lang="3D&quot;fr&quot;" xml:lang="3D&quot;fr&quot;">V=E2=80=99la tout</i>, =
as the Frenchman says.</p>
			<p>Beyond that, he was childish! If he made it, it would go down to post=
erity as Cavorite or Cavorine, and he would be made an <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z=" 3998:initialism"="">F.R.S.</abbr>, and his portrait given away as a scientific=
 worthy with <i epub:type="3D&quot;se:name.publication.journal&quot;">Nature</i>, and t=
hings like that. And that was all he saw! He would have dropped this bombsh=
ell into the world as though he had discovered a new species of gnat, if it=
 had not happened that I had come along. And there it would have lain and f=
izzled, like one or two other little things these scientific people have li=
t and dropped about us.</p>
			<p>When I realised this, it was I did the talking, and Cavor who said =
=E2=80=9CGo on!=E2=80=9D I jumped up. I paced the room, gesticulating like =
a boy of twenty. I tried to make him understand his duties and responsibili=
ties in the matter=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94<em>our</em> duties and responsibilitie=
s in the matter. I assured him we might make wealth enough to work any sort=
 of social revolution we fancied, we might own and order the whole world. I=
 told him of companies and patents, and the case for secret processes. All =
these things seemed to take him much as his mathematics had taken me. A loo=
k of perplexity came into his ruddy little face. He stammered something abo=
ut indifference to wealth, but I brushed all that aside. He had got to be r=
ich, and it was no good his stammering. I gave him to understand the sort o=
f man I was, and that I had had very considerable business experience. I di=
d not tell him I was an undischarged bankrupt at the time, because that was=
 temporary, but I think I reconciled my evident poverty with my financial c=
laims. And quite insensibly, in the way such projects grow, the understandi=
ng of a Cavorite monopoly grew up between us. He was to make the stuff, and=
 I was to make the boom.</p>
			<p>I stuck like a leech to the =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D didn=E2=80=99t exist for me.</p>
			<p>His idea was, that the profits I spoke of might go to endow research,=
 but that, of course, was a matter we had to settle later. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=
=80=99s all right,=E2=80=9D I shouted, =E2=80=9Cthat=E2=80=99s all right.=
=E2=80=9D The great point, as I insisted, was to get the thing done.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHere is a substance,=E2=80=9D I cried, =E2=80=9Cno home, no =
factory, no fortress, no ship can dare to be without=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94more =
universally applicable even than a patent medicine! There isn=E2=80=99t a s=
olitary aspect of it, not one of its ten thousand possible uses that will n=
ot make us rich, Cavor, beyond the dreams of avarice!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo!=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CI begin to see. It=E2=80=99s =
extraordinary how one gets new points of view by talking over things!=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd as it happens you have just talked to the right man!=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI suppose no one,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cis absolutely &lt;=
em&gt;averse to enormous wealth. Of course there is one thing=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He paused. I stood still.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt is just possible, you know, that we may not be able to ma=
ke it after all! It may be one of those things that are a theoretical possi=
bility, but a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there may be some li=
ttle hitch=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94!=E2=80=9D</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>But Cavor=E2=80=99s fears were groundless, so far as the actual makin=
g was concerned. On the 14th of October 1899 this incredible substance was =
made!</p>
			<p>Oddly enough, it was made at last by accident, when <abbr epub:type="=3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Cavor least expected it. He had fused=
 together a number of metals and certain other things=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I wi=
sh I knew the particulars now!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and he intended to leave th=
e mixture a week and then allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had miscalcula=
ted, the last stage in the combination would occur when the stuff sank to a=
 temperature of 60=C2=B0=E2=80=8A<abbr epub:type="3D&quot;se:temperature&quot;">F But it chanced that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had arisen about the fu=
rnace tending. Gibbs, who had previously seen to this, had suddenly attempt=
ed to shift it to the man who had been a gardener, on the score that coal w=
as soil, being dug, and therefore could not possibly fall within the provin=
ce of a joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener alleged, however, t=
hat coal was a metallic or ore-like substance, let alone that he was cook. =
But Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing that he was a joine=
r and that coal is notoriously fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs ceased to re=
plenish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor was too much immerse=
d in certain interesting problems concerning a Cavorite flying machine (neg=
lecting the resistance of the air and one or two other points) to perceive =
that anything was wrong. And the premature birth of his invention took plac=
e just as he was coming across the field to my bungalow for our afternoon t=
alk and tea.</abbr></p>
			<p>I remember the occasion with extreme vividness. The water was boiling=
, and everything was prepared, and the sound of his =E2=80=9C<i>zuzzoo</i>=
=E2=80=9D had brought me out upon the verandah. His active little figure wa=
s black against the autumnal sunset, and to the right the chimneys of his h=
ouse just rose above a gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the W=
ealden Hills, faint and blue, while to the left the hazy marsh spread out s=
pacious and serene. And then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94!</p>
			<p>The chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into a string of bricks as t=
hey rose, and the roof and a miscellany of furniture followed. Then overtak=
ing them came a huge white flame. The trees about the building swayed and w=
hirled and tore themselves to pieces, that sprang towards the flare. My ear=
s were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me deaf on one side for lif=
e, and all about me windows smashed, unheeded.</p>
			<p>I took three steps from the verandah towards Cavor=E2=80=99s house, a=
nd even as I did so came the wind.</p>
			<p>Instantly my coat tails were over my head, and I was progressing in g=
reat leaps and bounds, and quite against my will, towards him. In the same =
moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about, and flew through the screa=
ming air. I saw one of my chimney pots hit the ground within six yards of m=
e, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great strides towards the focus of=
 the disturbance. Cavor, kicking and flapping, came down again, rolled over=
 and over on the ground for a space, struggled up and was lifted and borne =
forward at an enormous velocity, vanishing at last among the labouring, las=
hing trees that writhed about his house.</p>
			<p>A mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of bluish shining substance r=
ushed up towards the zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing past =
me, dropped edgeways, hit the ground and fell flat, and then the worst was =
over. The aerial commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong gale, an=
d I became once more aware that I had breath and feet. By leaning back agai=
nst the wind I managed to stop, and could collect such wits as still remain=
ed to me.</p>
			<p>In that instant the whole face of the world had changed. The tranquil=
 sunset had vanished, the sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything wa=
s flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced back to see if my bungalow=
 was still in a general way standing, then staggered forward towards the tr=
ees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and through whose tall and leaf-denud=
ed branches shone the flames of his burning house.</p>
			<p>I entered the copse, dashing from one tree to another and clinging to=
 them, and for a space I sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of smashed =
branches and fencing that had banked itself against a portion of his garden=
 wall I perceived something stir. I made a run for this, but before I reach=
ed it a brown object separated itself, rose on two muddy legs and protruded=
 two drooping, bleeding hands. Some tattered ends of garment fluttered out =
from its middle portion and streamed before the wind.</p>
			<p>For a moment I did not recognise this earthy lump, and then I saw tha=
t it was Cavor, caked in the mud in which he had rolled. He leant forward a=
gainst the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes and mouth.</p>
			<p>He extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered a pace towards me. Hi=
s face worked with emotion, little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He lo=
oked as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I have ever seen, and hi=
s remark therefore amazed me exceeding. =E2=80=9CGratulate me,=E2=80=9D he =
gasped; =E2=80=9Cgratulate me!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCongratulate you!=E2=80=9D said I. =E2=80=9CGood heavens! Wh=
at for?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve done it.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou <em>have</em>. What on earth caused that explosion?=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>A gust of wind blew his words away. I understood him to say that it w=
asn=E2=80=99t an explosion at all. The wind hurled me into collision with h=
im, and we stood clinging to one another.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CTry and get back to my bungalow,=E2=80=9D I bawled in his ea=
r. He did not hear me, and shouted something about =E2=80=9Cthree martyrs=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94science,=E2=80=9D and also something about =E2=80=9Cnot m=
uch good.=E2=80=9D At the time he laboured under the impression that his th=
ree attendants had perished in the whirlwind. Happily this was incorrect. D=
irectly he had left for my bungalow they had gone off to the public-house i=
n Lympne to discuss the question of the furnaces over some trivial refreshm=
ent.</p>
			<p>I repeated my suggestion of getting back to my bungalow, and this tim=
e he understood. We clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at last to re=
ach the shelter of as much roof as was left to me. For a space we sat in ar=
mchairs and panted. All the windows were broken, and the lighter articles o=
f furniture were in great disorder, but no irrevocable damage was done. Hap=
pily the kitchen door had stood the pressure upon it, so that all my crocke=
ry and cooking materials had survived. The oil stove was still burning, and=
 I put on the water to boil again for tea. And that prepared, I could turn =
on Cavor for his explanation.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CQuite correct,=E2=80=9D he insisted; =E2=80=9Cquite correct.=
 I=E2=80=99ve done it, and it=E2=80=99s all right.=E2=80=9D</p>

=8A<abbr epub:type="3D&quot;se:temperature&quot;">F</abbr> and the process of its manuf=

			<p>=E2=80=9CI know that too,=E2=80=9D he remarked. =E2=80=9COnly this sh=
ows you how useless knowledge is unless you apply it. You see, over our Cav=
orite this ceased to be the case, the air there ceased to exert any pressur=
e, and the air round it and not over the Cavorite was exerting a pressure o=
f fourteen pounds and a half to the square inch upon this suddenly weightle=
ss air. Ah! you begin to see! The air all about the Cavorite crushed in upo=
n the air above it with irresistible force. The air above the Cavorite was =
forced upward violently, the air that rushed in to replace it immediately l=
ost weight, ceased to exert any pressure, followed suit, blew the ceiling t=
hrough and the roof off.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou perceive,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cit formed a sort of=
 atmospheric fountain, a kind of chimney in the atmosphere. And if the Cavo=
rite itself hadn=E2=80=99t been loose and so got sucked up the chimney, doe=
s it occur to you what would have happened?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I thought. =E2=80=9CI suppose,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cthe air woul=
d be rushing up and up over that infernal piece of stuff now.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPrecisely,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CA huge fountain=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSpouting into space! Good heavens! Why, it would have squirt=
ed all the atmosphere of the earth away! It would have robbed the world of =
air! It would have been the death of all mankind! That little lump of stuff=
!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNot exactly into space,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=80=9Cbut as=
 bad=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94practically. It would have whipped the air off the wo=
rld as one peels a banana, and flung it thousands of miles. It would have d=
ropped back again, of course=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94but on an asphyxiated world! =
From our point of view very little better than if it never came back!=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>I stared. As yet I was too amazed to realise how all my expectations =
had been upset. =E2=80=9CWhat do you mean to do now?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn the first place, if I may borrow a garden trowel I will r=
emove some of this earth with which I am encased, and then if I may avail m=
yself of your domestic conveniences I will have a bath. This done, we will =
converse more at leisure. It will be wise, I think=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94he laid a muddy hand on my arm=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cif nothing were=
 said of this affair beyond ourselves. I know I have caused great damage=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94probably even dwelling-houses may be ruined here and there u=
pon the countryside. But on the other hand, I cannot possibly pay for the d=
amage I have done, and if the real cause of this is published, it will lead=
 only to heartburning and the obstruction of my work. One cannot foresee <e= m="">everything, you know, and I cannot consent for one moment to add the=
 burden of practical considerations to my theorising. Later on, when you ha=
ve come in with your practical mind, and Cavorite is floated=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94floated <em>is</em> the word, isn=E2=80=99t it?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and it =
has realised all you anticipate for it, we may set matters right with these=
 persons. But not now=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94not now. If no other explanation is =
offered, people, in the present unsatisfactory state of meteorological scie=
nce, will ascribe all this to a cyclone; there might be a public subscripti=
on, and as my house has collapsed and been burnt, I should in that case rec=
eive a considerable share in the compensation, which would be extremely hel=
pful to the prosecution of our researches. But if it is known that <em>I</em></e=><em> caused this, there will be no public subscription, and everybody will be=
 put out. Practically I should never get a chance of working in peace again=
. My three assistants may or may not have perished. That is a detail. If th=
ey have, it is no great loss; they were more zealous than able, and this pr=
emature event must be largely due to their joint neglect of the furnace. If=
 they have not perished, I doubt if they have the intelligence to explain t=
he affair. They will accept the cyclone story. And if, during the temporary=
 unfitness of my house for occupation, I may lodge in one of the untenanted=
 rooms of this bungalow of yours=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</em></p><em>
			<p>He paused and regarded me.</p>
			<p>A man of such possibilities, I reflected, is no ordinary guest to ent=
ertain.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPerhaps,=E2=80=9D said I, rising to my feet, =E2=80=9Cwe had=
 better begin by looking for a trowel,=E2=80=9D and I led the way to the sc=
attered vestiges of the greenhouse.</p>
			<p>And while he was having his bath I considered the entire question alo=
ne. It was clear there were drawbacks to <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-titl=" e"="">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Cavor=E2=80=99s society I had not foreseen. The absentmi=
ndedness that had just escaped depopulating the terrestrial globe, might at=
 any moment result in some other grave inconvenience. On the other hand I w=
as young, my affairs were in a mess, and I was in just the mood for reckles=
s adventure=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94with a chance of something good at the end of =
it. I had quite settled in my mind that I was to have half at least in that=
 aspect of the affair. Fortunately I held my bungalow, as I have already ex=
plained, on a three-year agreement, without being responsible for repairs; =
and my furniture, such as there was of it, had been hastily purchased, was =
unpaid for, insured, and altogether devoid of associations. In the end I de=
cided to keep on with him, and see the business through.</p>
			<p>Certainly the aspect of things had changed very greatly. I no longer =
doubted at all the enormous possibilities of the substance, but I began to =
have doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots.</p>
			<p>We set to work at once to reconstruct his laboratory and proceed with=
 our experiments. Cavor talked more on my level than he had ever done befor=
e, when it came to the question of how we should make the stuff next.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COf course we must make it again,=E2=80=9D he said, with a so=
rt of glee I had not expected in him, =E2=80=9Cof course we must make it ag=
ain. We have caught a Tartar, perhaps, but we have left the theoretical beh=
ind us for good and all. If we can possibly avoid wrecking this little plan=
et of ours, we will. But=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94there <em>must</em> be risks! The=
re must be. In experimental work there always are. And here, as a practical=
 man, <em>you</em> must come in. For my own part it seems to me we might ma=
ke it edgeways, perhaps, and very thin. Yet I don=E2=80=99t know. I have a =
certain dim perception of another method. I can hardly explain it yet. But =
curiously enough it came into my mind, while I was rolling over and over in=
 the mud before the wind, and very doubtful how the whole adventure was to =
end, as being absolutely the thing I ought to have done.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Even with my aid we found some little difficulty, and meanwhile we ke=
pt at work restoring the laboratory. There was plenty to do before it was a=
bsolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form and method of our secon=
d attempt. Our only hitch was the strike of the three labourers, who object=
ed to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we compromised after two da=
ys=E2=80=99 delay.</p>

			<p>I remember the occasion very distinctly when Cavor told me of his ide=
a of the sphere. He had had intimations of it before, but at the time it se=
emed to come to him in a rush. We were returning to the bungalow for tea, a=
nd on the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted, =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s=
 it! That finishes it! A sort of roller blind!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CFinishes what?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSpace=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94anywhere! The moon!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat do you mean?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMean? Why=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it must be a sphere! That=E2=80=
=99s what I mean!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I saw I was out of it, and for a time I let him talk in his own fashi=
on. I hadn=E2=80=99t the ghost of an idea then of his drift. But after he h=
ad taken tea he made it clear to me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s like this,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CLast time=
 I ran this stuff that cuts things off from gravitation into a flat tank wi=
th an overlap that held it down. And directly it had cooled and the manufac=
ture was completed all that uproar happened, nothing above it weighed anyth=
ing, the air went squirting up, the house squirted up, and if the stuff its=
elf hadn=E2=80=99t squirted up too, I don=E2=80=99t know what would have ha=
ppened! But suppose the substance is loose, and quite free to go up?=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt will go up at once!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CExactly. With no more disturbance than firing a big gun.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut what good will that do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m going up with it!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I put down my teacup and stared at him.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CImagine a sphere,=E2=80=9D he explained, =E2=80=9Clarge enou=
gh to hold two people and their luggage. It will be made of steel lined wit=
h thick glass; it will contain a proper store of solidified air, concentrat=
ed food, water-distilling apparatus, and so forth. And enamelled, as it wer=

			<p>=E2=80=9CThere was a similar problem about a dumpling.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes, I know. But how?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s perfectly easy. An airtight manhole is all th=
at is needed. That, of course, will have to be a little complicated; there =
will have to be a valve, so that things may be thrown out, if necessary, wi=
thout much loss of air.=E2=80=9D</p>

			<p>But Cavor was not a reader of fiction.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI begin to see,=E2=80=9D I said slowly. =E2=80=9CAnd you cou=
ld get in and screw yourself up while the Cavorite was warm, and as soon as=
 it cooled it would become impervious to gravitation, and off you would fly=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAt a tangent.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou would go off in a straight line=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=9D I stopped abruptly. =E2=80=9CWhat is to prevent the thing travelling in=
 a straight line into space forever?=E2=80=9D I asked. =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=
=99re not safe to get anywhere, and if you do=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94how will you=
 get back?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve just thought of that,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=
=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s what I meant when I said the thing is finished. The in=
ner glass sphere can be airtight and, except for the manhole, continuous, a=
nd the steel sphere can be made in sections, each section capable of rollin=
g up after the fashion of a roller blind. These can easily be worked by spr=
ings, and released and checked by electricity conveyed by platinum wires fu=
sed through the glass. All that is merely a question of detail. So you see,=
 that except for the thickness of the blind rollers, the Cavorite exterior =
of the sphere will consist of windows or blinds, whichever you like to call=
 them. Well, when all these windows or blinds are shut, no light, no heat, =
no gravitation, no radiant energy of any sort will get at the inside of the=
 sphere, it will fly on through space in a straight line, as you say. But o=
pen a window, imagine one of the windows open! Then at once any heavy body =
that chances to be in that direction will attract us=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=

			<p>=E2=80=9CTwo hundred million miles at present,=E2=80=9D said Cavor ai=
rily; =E2=80=9Cand you go close by the sun.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>My imagination was picking itself up again. =E2=80=9CAfter all,=E2=80=
=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cthere=E2=80=99s something in these things. There=E2=80=
=99s travel=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>An extraordinary possibility came rushing into my mind. Suddenly I sa=
w, as in a vision, the whole solar system threaded with Cavorite liners and=
 spheres deluxe. =E2=80=9CRights of preemption,=E2=80=9D came floating into=
 my head=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94planetary rights of preemption. I recalled the ol=
d Spanish monopoly in American gold. It wasn=E2=80=99t as though it was jus=
t this planet or that=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it was all of them. I stared at Cavo=
r=E2=80=99s rubicund face, and suddenly my imagination was leaping and danc=
ing. I stood up, I walked up and down; my tongue was unloosened.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m beginning to take it in,=E2=80=9D I said; =E2=80=
=9CI=E2=80=99m beginning to take it in.=E2=80=9D The transition from doubt =
to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any time at all. =E2=80=9CBut this is=
 tremendous!=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=9CThis is Imperial! I haven=E2=80=99t=
 been dreaming of this sort of thing.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Once the chill of my opposition was removed, his own pent-up exciteme=
nt had play. He too got up and paced. He too gesticulated and shouted. We b=
ehaved like men inspired. We <em>were</em> men inspired.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll settle all that!=E2=80=9D he said in answer to=
 some incidental difficulty that had pulled me up. =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll s=
oon settle all that! We=E2=80=99ll start the drawings for mouldings this ve=
ry night.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll start them now,=E2=80=9D I responded, and we h=
urried off to the laboratory to begin upon this work forthwith.</p>
			<p>I was like a child in Wonderland all that night. The dawn found us bo=
th still at work=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94we kept our electric light going heedless=
 of the day. I remember now exactly how those drawings looked. I shaded and=
 tinted, while Cavor drew=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94smudged and haste-marked they we=
re in every line, but wonderfully correct. We got out the orders for the st=
eel blinds and frames we needed from that night=E2=80=99s work, and the gla=
ss sphere was designed within a week. We gave up our afternoon conversation=
s and our old routine altogether. We worked, and we slept and ate when we c=
ould work no longer for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected even ou=
r three men, though they had no idea what the sphere was for. Through those=
 days the man Gibbs gave up walking, and went everywhere, even across the r=
oom, at a sort of fussy run.</p>
			<p>And it grew=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the sphere. December passed, January=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94I spent a day with a broom sweeping a path through the snow =
from bungalow to laboratory=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94February, March. By the end of=
 March the completion was in sight. In January had come a team of horses, a=
 huge packing-case; we had our thick glass sphere now ready, and in positio=
n under the crane we had rigged to sling it into the steel shell. All the b=
ars and blinds of the steel shell=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it was not really a sphe=
rical shell, but polyhedral, with a roller blind to each facet=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94had arrived by February, and the lower half was bolted together. The =
Cavorite was half made by March, the metallic paste had gone through two of=
 the stages in its manufacture, and we had plastered quite half of it on to=
 the steel bars and blinds. It was astonishing how closely we kept to the l=
ines of Cavor=E2=80=99s first inspiration in working out the scheme. When t=
he bolting together of the sphere was finished, he proposed to remove the r=
ough roof of the temporary laboratory in which the work was done, and build=
 a furnace about it. So the last stage of Cavorite making, in which the pas=
te is heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, would be accomplishe=
d when it was already on the sphere.</p>
			<p>And then we had to discuss and decide what provisions we were to take=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94compressed foods, concentrated essences, steel cylinders =
containing reserve oxygen, an arrangement for removing carbonic acid and wa=
ste from the air and restoring oxygen by means of sodium peroxide, water co=
ndensers, and so forth. I remember the little heap they made in the corner=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94tins, and rolls, and boxes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94convincingly =
matter-of-fact.</p>
			<p>It was a strenuous time, with little chance of thinking. But one day,=
 when we were drawing near the end, an odd mood came over me. I had been br=
icking up the furnace all the morning, and I sat down by these possessions =
dead beat. Everything seemed dull and incredible.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut look here, Cavor,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CAfter all! W=
hat=E2=80=99s it all for?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He smiled. =E2=80=9CThe thing now is to go.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe moon,=E2=80=9D I reflected. =E2=80=9CBut what do you exp=
ect? I thought the moon was a dead world.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat do you expect?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re going to see.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C<em>Are</em> we?=E2=80=9D I said, and stared before me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou are tired,=E2=80=9D he remarked. =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99d =
better take a walk this afternoon.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D I said obstinately; =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m going =
to finish this brickwork.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>And I did, and insured myself a night of insomnia.</p>
			<p>I don=E2=80=99t think I have ever had such a night. I had some bad ti=
mes before my business collapse, but the very worst of those was sweet slum=
ber compared to this infinity of aching wakefulness. I was suddenly in the =
most enormous funk at the thing we were going to do.</p>
			<p>I do not remember before that night thinking at all of the risks we w=
ere running. Now they came like that array of spectres that once beleaguere=
d Prague, and camped around me. The strangeness of what we were about to do=
, the unearthliness of it, overwhelmed me. I was like a man awakened out of=
 pleasant dreams to the most horrible surroundings. I lay, eyes wide open, =
and the sphere seemed to get more flimsy and feeble, and Cavor more unreal =
and fantastic, and the whole enterprise madder and madder every moment.</p>
			<p>I got out of bed and wandered about. I sat at the window and stared a=
t the immensity of space. Between the stars was the void, the unfathomable =
darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary knowledge of astronomy I had ga=
ined in my irregular reading, but it was all too vague to furnish any idea =
of the things we might expect. At last I got back to bed and snatched some =
moments of sleep=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94moments of nightmare rather=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94in which I fell and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the =
sky.</p>
			<p>I astonished Cavor at breakfast. I told him shortly, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=
=99m not coming with you in the sphere.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I met all his protests with a sullen persistence. =E2=80=9CThe thing=
=E2=80=99s too mad,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cand I won=E2=80=99t come. The=
 thing=E2=80=99s too mad.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I would not go with him to the laboratory. I fretted about my bungalo=
w for a time, and then took hat and stick and set off alone, I knew not whi=
ther. It chanced to be a glorious morning: a warm wind and deep blue sky, t=
he first green of spring abroad, and multitudes of birds singing. I lunched=
 on beef and beer in a little public-house near Elham, and startled the lan=
dlord by remarking apropos of the weather, =E2=80=9CA man who leaves the wo=
rld when days of this sort are about is a fool!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s what I says when I heerd on it!=E2=80=9D said=
 the landlord, and I found that for one poor soul at least this world had p=
roved excessive, and there had been a throat-cutting. I went on with a new =
twist to my thoughts.</p>
			<p>In the afternoon I had a pleasant sleep in a sunny place, and went my=
 way refreshed.</p>
			<p>I came to a comfortable-looking inn near Canterbury. It was bright wi=
th creepers, and the landlady was a clean old woman and took my eye. I foun=
d I had just enough money to pay for my lodging with her. I decided to stop=
 the night there. She was a talkative body, and among many other particular=
s I learnt she had never been to London. =E2=80=9CCanterbury=E2=80=99s as f=
ar as ever I been,=E2=80=9D she said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not one of your =
gadabout sort.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow would you like a trip to the moon?=E2=80=9D I cried.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI never did hold with them ballooneys,=E2=80=9D she said, ev=
idently under the impression that this was a common excursion enough. =E2=
=80=9CI wouldn=E2=80=99t go up in one=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94not forever so.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>This struck me as being funny. After I had supped I sat on a bench by=
 the door of the inn and gossiped with two labourers about brick-making, an=
d motor cars, and the cricket of last year. And in the sky a faint new cres=
cent, blue and vague as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun.</p>
			<p>The next day I returned to Cavor. =E2=80=9CI am coming,=E2=80=9D I sa=
id. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve been a little out of order, that=E2=80=99s all.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>That was the only time I felt any serious doubt of our enterprise. Ne=
rves purely! After that I worked a little more carefully, and took a trudge=
 for an hour every day. And at last, save for the heating in the furnace, o=
ur labours were at an end.</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGo on,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, as I sat across the edge of the =
manhole and looked down into the black interior of the sphere. We two were =
alone. It was evening, the sun had set, and the stillness of the twilight w=
as upon everything.</p>
			<p>I drew my other leg inside and slid down the smooth glass to the bott=
om of the sphere, then turned to take the cans of food and other impediment=
a from Cavor. The interior was warm, the thermometer stood at eighty, and a=
s we should lose little or none of this by radiation, we were dressed in sh=
oes and thin flannels. We had, however, a bundle of thick woollen clothing =
and several thick blankets to guard against mischance. By Cavor=E2=80=99s d=
irection I placed the packages, the cylinders of oxygen, and so forth, loos=
ely about my feet, and soon we had everything in. He walked about the roofl=
ess shed for a time seeking anything we had overlooked, and then crawled in=
 after me. I noted something in his hand.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat have you got there?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHaven=E2=80=99t you brought anything to read?=E2=80=9D</p>

=9CThere=E2=80=99s something there!=E2=80=9D</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CWe shall be an hour.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked out. It was an old number of <i epub:type="3D&quot;se:name.publica=" tion.magazine"="">Titbits</i> that one of the men must have brought. Further a=
way in the corner I saw a torn <i epub:type="3D&quot;se:name.publication.newspape=" r"="">Lloyd=E2=80=99s News</i>. I scrambled back into the sphere with these th=
ings. =E2=80=9CWhat have you got?=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>I took the book from his hand and read, =E2=80=9CThe Works of William=
 Shakespeare.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He coloured slightly. =E2=80=9CMy education has been so purely scient=
ific=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D he said apologetically.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNever read him?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNever.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe knew a little you know=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in an irregular s=
ort of way.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPrecisely what I am told,=E2=80=9D said Cavor.</p>
			<p>I assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the manhole, and then h=
e pressed a stud to close the corresponding blind in the outer case. The li=
ttle oblong of twilight vanished. We were in darkness.</p>
			<p>For a time neither of us spoke. Although our case would not be imperv=
ious to sound, everything was very still. I perceived there was nothing to =
grip when the shock of our start should come, and I realised that I should =
be uncomfortable for want of a chair.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhy have we no chairs?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve settled all that,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=80=
=9CWe shan=E2=80=99t need them.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhy not?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou will see,=E2=80=9D he said, in the tone of a man who ref=
uses to talk.</p>
			<p>I became silent. Suddenly it had come to me clear and vivid that I wa=
s a fool to be inside that sphere. Even now, I asked myself, is it too late=
 to withdraw? The world outside the sphere, I knew, would be cold and inhos=
pitable enough to me=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94for weeks I had been living on subsid=
ies from Cavor=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94but after all, would it be as cold as the i=
nfinite zero, as inhospitable as empty space? If it had not been for the ap=
pearance of cowardice, I believe that even then I should have made him let =
me out. But I hesitated on that score, and hesitated, and grew fretful and =
angry, and the time passed.</p>
			<p>There came a little jerk, a noise like champagne being uncorked in an=
other room, and a faint whistling sound. For just one instant I had a sense=
 of enormous tension, a transient conviction that my feet were pressing dow=
nward with a force of countless tons. It lasted for an infinitesimal time.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>But it stirred me to action. =E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I said into the=
 darkness, =E2=80=9Cmy nerve=E2=80=99s in rags.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=A6 I don=E2=80=99t think=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I stopped. He made no answer.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConfound it!=E2=80=9D I cried; =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m a fool! =
What business have I here? I=E2=80=99m not coming, Cavor. The thing=E2=80=
=99s too risky. I=E2=80=99m getting out.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou can=E2=80=99t,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCan=E2=80=99t! We=E2=80=99ll soon see about that!=E2=80=9D<!--
p-->
			</p><p>He made no answer for ten seconds. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s too late for=
 us to quarrel now, Bedford,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CThat little jerk wa=
s the start. Already we are flying as swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf =
of space.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D I said, and then it didn=E2=80=
=99t seem to matter what happened. For a time I was, as it were, stunned; I=
 had nothing to say. It was just as if I had never heard of this idea of le=
aving the world before. Then I perceived an unaccountable change in my bodi=
ly sensations. It was a feeling of lightness, of unreality. Coupled with th=
at was a queer sensation in the head, an apoplectic effect almost, and a th=
umping of blood-vessels at the ears. Neither of these feelings diminished a=
s time went on, but at last I got so used to them that I experienced no inc=
onvenience.</p>
			<p>I heard a click, and a little glow lamp came into being.</p>
			<p>I saw Cavor=E2=80=99s face, as white as I felt my own to be. We regar=
ded one another in silence. The transparent blackness of the glass behind h=
im made him seem as though he floated in a void.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, we=E2=80=99re committed,=E2=80=9D I said at last.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cwe=E2=80=99re committed.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t move,=E2=80=9D he exclaimed, at some suggestio=
n of a gesture. =E2=80=9CLet your muscles keep quite lax=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a=
s if you were in bed. We are in a little universe of our own. Look at those=
 things!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He pointed to the loose cases and bundles that had been lying on the =
blankets in the bottom of the sphere. I was astonished to see that they wer=
e floating now nearly a foot from the spherical wall. Then I saw from his s=
hadow that Cavor was no longer leaning against the glass. I thrust out my h=
and behind me, and found that I too was suspended in space, clear of the gl=
ass.</p>
			<p>I did not cry out nor gesticulate, but fear came upon me. It was like=
 being held and lifted by something=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94you know not what. The=
 mere touch of my hand against the glass moved me rapidly. I understood wha=
t had happened, but that did not prevent my being afraid. We were cut off f=
rom all exterior gravitation, only the attraction of objects within our sph=
ere had effect. Consequently everything that was not fixed to the glass was=
 falling=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94slowly because of the slightness of our masses=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94towards the centre of gravity of our little world, which see=
med to be somewhere about the middle of the sphere, but rather nearer to my=
self than Cavor, on account of my greater weight.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe must turn round,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=80=9Cand float =
back to back, with the things between us.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>It was the strangest sensation conceivable, floating thus loosely in =
space, at first indeed horribly strange, and when the horror passed, not di=
sagreeable at all, exceeding restful; indeed, the nearest thing in earthly =
experience to it that I know is lying on a very thick, soft feather bed. Bu=
t the quality of utter detachment and independence! I had not reckoned on t=
hings like this. I had expected a violent jerk at starting, a giddy sense o=
f speed. Instead I felt=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94as if I were disembodied. It was n=
ot like the beginning of a journey; it was like the beginning of a dream.<!--

			<p>Presently Cavor extinguished the light. He said we had not overmuch e=
nergy stored, and that what we had we must economise for reading. For a tim=
e, whether it was long or short I do not know, there was nothing but blank =
darkness.</p>
			<p>A question floated up out of the void. =E2=80=9CHow are we pointing?=
=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CWhat is our direction?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe are flying away from the earth at a tangent, and as the m=
oon is near her third quarter we are going somewhere towards her. I will op=
en a blind=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Came a click, and then a window in the outer case yawned open. The sk=
y outside was as black as the darkness within the sphere, but the shape of =
the open window was marked by an infinite number of stars.</p>
			<p>Those who have only seen the starry sky from the earth cannot imagine=
 its appearance when the vague half-luminous veil of our air has been withd=
rawn. The stars we see on earth are the mere scattered survivors that penet=
rate our misty atmosphere. But now at last I could realise the meaning of t=
he hosts of heaven!</p>
			<p>Stranger things we were presently to see, but that airless, starduste=
d sky! Of all things, I think that will be one of the last I shall forget.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>The little window vanished with a click, another beside it snapped op=
en and instantly closed, and then a third, and for a moment I had to close =
my eyes because of the blinding splendour of the waning moon.</p>
			<p>For a space I had to stare at Cavor and the white-lit things about me=
 to season my eyes to light again, before I could turn them towards that pa=
llid glare.</p>
			<p>Four windows were open in order that the gravitation of the moon migh=
t act upon all the substances in our sphere. I found I was no longer floati=
ng freely in space, but that my feet were resting on the glass in the direc=
tion of the moon. The blankets and cases of provisions were also creeping s=
lowly down the glass, and presently came to rest so as to block out a porti=
on of the view. It seemed to me, of course, that I looked =E2=80=9Cdown=E2=
=80=9D when I looked at the moon. On earth =E2=80=9Cdown=E2=80=9D means ear=
thward, the way things fall, and =E2=80=9Cup=E2=80=9D the reverse direction=
. Now the pull of gravitation was towards the moon, and for all I knew to t=
he contrary our earth was overhead. And, of course, when all the Cavorite b=
linds were closed, =E2=80=9Cdown=E2=80=9D was towards the centre of our sph=
ere, and =E2=80=9Cup=E2=80=9D towards its outer wall.</p>
			<p>It was curiously unlike earthly experience, too, to have the light co=
ming <em>up</em> to one. On earth light falls from above, or comes slanting=
 down sideways, but here it came from beneath our feet, and to see our shad=
ows we had to look up.</p>
			<p>At first it gave me a sort of vertigo to stand only on thick glass an=
d look down upon the moon through hundreds of thousands of miles of vacant =
space; but this sickness passed very speedily. And then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94th=
e splendour of the sight!</p>
			<p>The reader may imagine it best if he will lie on the ground some warm=
 summer=E2=80=99s night and look between his upraised feet at the moon, but=
 for some reason, probably because the absence of air made it so much more =
luminous, the moon seemed already considerably larger than it does from ear=
th. The minutest details of its surface were acutely clear. And since we di=
d not see it through air, its outline was bright and sharp, there was no gl=
ow or halo about it, and the stardust that covered the sky came right to it=
s very margin, and marked the outline of its unilluminated part. And as I s=
tood and stared at the moon between my feet, that perception of the impossi=
ble that had been with me off and on ever since our start, returned again w=
ith tenfold conviction.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cthis takes me queerly. Thos=

ittle advertisements. =E2=80=9CA gentleman of private means is willing to l=

wanted to sell a Cutaway bicycle, =E2=80=9Cquite new and cost =C2=A315,=E2=
=80=9D for five pounds; and a lady in distress wished to dispose of some fi=
sh knives and forks, =E2=80=9Ca wedding present,=E2=80=9D at a great sacrif=
ice. No doubt some simple soul was sagely examining these knives and forks,=
 and another triumphantly riding off on that bicycle, and a third trustfull=

and let the paper drift from my hand.</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CBy the way,=E2=80=9D I asked, =E2=80=9Chow small a thing wil=
l the biggest telescopes show upon the moon?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COne could see a fair-sized church. One could certainly see a=
ny towns or buildings, or anything like the handiwork of men. There might p=
erhaps be insects, something in the way of ants, for example, so that they =
could hide in deep burrows from the lunar night, or some new sort of creatu=
res having no earthly parallel. That is the most probable thing, if we are =
to find life there at all. Think of the difference in conditions! Life must=
 fit itself to a day as long as fourteen earthly days, a cloudless sun-blaz=
e of fourteen days, and then a night of equal length, growing ever colder a=
nd colder under these cold, sharp stars. In that night there must be cold, =
the ultimate cold, absolute zero, 273=C2=B0=E2=80=8A<abbr epub:type="3D&quot;se:t=" emperature"="">C.</abbr> below the earthly freezing point. Whatever life there=
 is must hibernate through <em>that</em>, and rise again each day.=E2=80=9D=
</p>
			<p>He mused. =E2=80=9COne can imagine something worm-like,=E2=80=9D he s=
aid, =E2=80=9Ctaking its air solid as an earthworm swallows earth, or thick=
-skinned monsters=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBy the by,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cwhy didn=E2=80=99t we b=
ring a gun?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He did not answer that question. =E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D he concluded, =
=E2=80=9Cwe just have to go. We shall see when we get there.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I remembered something. =E2=80=9COf course, there=E2=80=99s my minera=
ls, anyhow,=E2=80=9D I said; =E2=80=9Cwhatever the conditions may be.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>Presently he told me he wished to alter our course a little by lettin=
g the earth tug at us for a moment. He was going to open one earthward blin=
d for thirty seconds. He warned me that it would make my head swim, and adv=
ised me to extend my hands against the glass to break my fall. I did as he =
directed, and thrust my feet against the bales of food cases and air cylind=
ers to prevent their falling upon me. Then with a click the window flew ope=
n. I fell clumsily upon hands and face, and saw for a moment between my bla=
ck extended fingers our mother earth=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a planet in a downwar=
d sky.</p>
			<p>We were still very near=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94Cavor told me the distance w=
as perhaps eight hundred miles=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and the huge terrestrial di=
sk filled all heaven. But already it was plain to see that the world was a =
globe. The land below us was in twilight and vague, but westward the vast g=
rey stretches of the Atlantic shone like molten silver under the receding d=
ay. I think I recognised the cloud-dimmed coastlines of France and Spain an=
d the south of England, and then, with a click, the shutter closed again, a=
nd I found myself in a state of extraordinary confusion sliding slowly over=
 the smooth glass.</p>
			<p>When at last things settled themselves in my mind again, it seemed qu=
ite beyond question that the moon was =E2=80=9Cdown=E2=80=9D and under my f=
eet, and that the earth was somewhere away on the level of the horizon=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94the earth that had been =E2=80=9Cdown=E2=80=9D to me and my =
kindred since the beginning of things.</p>
			<p>So slight were the exertions required of us, so easy did the practica=
l annihilation of our weight make all we had to do, that the necessity for =
taking refreshment did not occur to us for nearly six hours (by Cavor=E2=80=
=99s chronometer) after our start. I was amazed at that lapse of time. Even=
 then I was satisfied with very little. Cavor examined the apparatus for ab=
sorbing carbonic acid and water, and pronounced it to be in satisfactory or=
der, our consumption of oxygen having been extraordinarily slight. And our =
talk being exhausted for the time, and there being nothing further for us t=
o do, we gave way to a curious drowsiness that had come upon us, and spread=
ing our blankets on the bottom of the sphere in such a manner as to shut ou=
t most of the moonlight, wished each other good night, and almost immediate=
ly fell asleep.</p>
			<p>And so, sleeping, and sometimes talking and reading a little, and at =
times eating, although without any keenness of appetite,<a href="3D&quot;https://=" standardebooks.org="" ebooks="" h-g-wells="" the-first-men-in-the-moon="" text="" single-p="age#note-1&quot;" id="3D&quot;noteref-1&quot;" epub:type="3D&quot;noteref&quot;">1</a> but for the most p=
art in a sort of quiescence that was neither waking nor slumber, we fell th=
rough a space of time that had neither night nor day in it, silently, softl=
y, and swiftly down towards the moon.</p>

				<p epub:type="3D&quot;title&quot;">The Landing on the Moon</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>I remember how one day Cavor suddenly opened six of our shutters and =
blinded me so that I cried aloud at him. The whole area was moon, a stupend=
ous scimitar of white dawn with its edge hacked out by notches of darkness,=
 the crescent shore of an ebbing tide of darkness, out of which peaks and p=
innacles came climbing into the blaze of the sun. I take it the reader has =
seen pictures or photographs of the moon, so that I need not describe the b=
roader features of that landscape, those spacious ringlike ranges vaster th=
an any terrestrial mountains, their summits shining in the day, their shado=
ws harsh and deep, the grey disordered plains, the ridges, hills, and crate=
rlets, all passing at last from a blazing illumination into a common myster=
y of black. Athwart this world we were flying scarcely a hundred miles abov=
e its crests and pinnacles. And now we could see, what no eye on earth will=
 ever see, that under the blaze of the day the harsh outlines of the rocks =
and ravines of the plains and crater floor grew grey and indistinct under a=
 thickening haze, that the white of their lit surfaces broke into lumps and=
 patches, and broke again and shrank and vanished, and that here and there =
strange tints of brown and olive grew and spread.</p>
			<p>But little time we had for watching then. For now we had come to the =
real danger of our journey. We had to drop ever closer to the moon as we sp=
un about it, to slacken our pace and watch our chance, until at last we cou=
ld dare to drop upon its surface.</p>
			<p>For Cavor that was a time of intense exertion; for me it was an anxio=
us inactivity. I seemed perpetually to be getting out of his way. He leapt =
about the sphere from point to point with an agility that would have been i=
mpossible on earth. He was perpetually opening and closing the Cavorite win=
dows, making calculations, consulting his chronometer by means of the glow =
lamp during those last eventful hours. For a long time we had all our windo=
ws closed and hung silently in darkness, hurling through space.</p>
			<p>Then he was feeling for the shutter studs, and suddenly four windows =
were open. I staggered and covered my eyes, drenched and scorched and blind=
ed by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun beneath my feet. Then again the=
 shutters snapped, leaving my brain spinning in a darkness that pressed aga=
inst the eyes. And after that I floated in another vast, black silence.</p>
			<p>Then Cavor switched on the electric light, and told me he proposed to=
 bind all our luggage together with the blankets about it, against the conc=
ussion of our descent. We did this with our windows closed, because in that=
 way our goods arranged themselves naturally at the centre of the sphere. T=
hat too was a strange business; we two men floating loose in that spherical=
 space, and packing and pulling ropes. Imagine it if you can! No up nor dow=
n, and every effort resulting in unexpected movements. Now I would be press=
ed against the glass with the full force of Cavor=E2=80=99s thrust, now I w=
ould be kicking helplessly in a void. Now the star of the electric light wo=
uld be overhead, now under foot. Now Cavor=E2=80=99s feet would float up be=
fore my eyes, and now we would be crossways to each other. But at last our =
goods were safely bound together in a big soft bale, all except two blanket=
s with head holes that we were to wrap about ourselves.</p>
			<p>Then for a flash Cavor opened a window moonward, and we saw that we w=
ere dropping towards a huge central crater with a number of minor craters g=
rouped in a sort of cross about it. And then again Cavor flung our little s=
phere open to the scorching, blinding sun. I think he was using the sun=E2=
=80=99s attraction as a brake. =E2=80=9CCover yourself with a blanket,=E2=
=80=9D he cried, thrusting himself from me, and for a moment I did not unde=
rstand.</p>
			<p>Then I hauled the blanket from beneath my feet and got it about me an=
d over my head and eyes. Abruptly he closed the shutters again, snapped one=
 open again and closed it, then suddenly began snapping them all open, each=
 safely into its steel roller. There came a jar, and then we were rolling o=
ver and over, bumping against the glass and against the big bale of our lug=
gage, and clutching at each other, and outside some white substance splashe=
d as if we were rolling down a slope of snow.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=A6</p>
			<p>Over, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=A6</p>
			<p>Came a thud, and I was half buried under the bale of our possessions,=
 and for a space everything was still. Then I could hear Cavor puffing and =
grunting, and the snapping of a shutter in its sash. I made an effort, thru=
st back our blanket-wrapped luggage, and emerged from beneath it. Our open =
windows were just visible as a deeper black set with stars.</p>
			<p>We were still alive, and we were lying in the darkness of the shadow =
of the wall of the great crater into which we had fallen.</p>
			<p>We sat getting our breath again, and feeling the bruises on our limbs=
. I don=E2=80=99t think either of us had had a very clear expectation of su=
ch rough handling as we had received. I struggled painfully to my feet. =E2=
=80=9CAnd now,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cto look at the landscape of the mo=
on! But=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94! It=E2=80=99s tremendously dark, Cavor!=E2=80=9D&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>The glass was dewy, and as I spoke I wiped at it with my blanket. =E2=
=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re half-an-hour or so beyond the day,=E2=80=9D he said. =
=E2=80=9CWe must wait.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>It was impossible to distinguish anything. We might have been in a sp=
here of steel for all that we could see. My rubbing with the blanket simply=
 smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it became opaque again with =
freshly condensed moisture mixed with an increasing quantity of blanket hai=
rs. Of course I ought not to have used the blanket. In my efforts to clear =
the glass I slipped upon the damp surface, and hurt my shin against one of =
the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our bale.</p>
			<p>The thing was exasperating=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it was absurd. Here we we=
re just arrived upon the moon, amidst we knew not what wonders, and all we =
could see was the grey and streaming wall of the bubble in which we had com=
e.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConfound it!=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cbut at this rate we m=
ight have stopped at home;=E2=80=9D and I squatted on the bale and shivered=
, and drew my blanket closer about me.</p>
			<p>Abruptly the moisture turned to spangles and fronds of frost. =E2=80=
=9CCan you reach the electric heater,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=80=9CYes=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94that black knob. Or we shall freeze.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I did not wait to be told twice. =E2=80=9CAnd now,=E2=80=9D said I, =
=E2=80=9Cwhat are we to do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWait,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWait?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COf course. We shall have to wait until our air gets warm aga=
in, and then this glass will clear. We can=E2=80=99t do anything till then.=
 It=E2=80=99s night here yet; we must wait for the day to overtake us. Mean=
while, don=E2=80=99t you feel hungry?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>For a space I did not answer him, but sat fretting. I turned reluctan=
tly from the smeared puzzle of the glass and stared at his face. =E2=80=9CY=
es,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9CI am hungry. I feel somehow enormously disapp=
ointed. I had expected=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I don=E2=80=99t know what I had exp=
ected, but not this.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I summoned my philosophy, and rearranging my blanket about me sat dow=
n on the bale again and began my first meal on the moon. I don=E2=80=99t th=
ink I finished it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I forget. Presently, first in patches, t=
hen running rapidly together into wider spaces, came the clearing of the gl=
ass, came the drawing of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our ey=
es.</p>
			<p>We peered out upon the landscape of the moon.</p>

				<p epub:type="3D&quot;title&quot;">Sunrise on the Moon</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>As we saw it first it was the wildest and most desolate of scenes. We=
 were in an enormous amphitheatre, a vast circular plain, the floor of the =
giant crater. Its cliff-like walls closed us in on every side. From the wes=
tward the light of the unseen sun fell upon them, reaching to the very foot=
 of the cliff, and showed a disordered escarpment of drab and greyish rock,=
 lined here and there with banks and crevices of snow. This was perhaps a d=
ozen miles away, but at first no intervening atmosphere diminished in the s=
lightest the minutely detailed brilliancy with which these things glared at=
 us. They stood out clear and dazzling against a background of starry black=
ness that seemed to our earthly eyes rather a gloriously spangled velvet cu=
rtain than the spaciousness of the sky.</p>
			<p>The eastward cliff was at first merely a starless selvedge to the sta=
rry dome. No rosy flush, no creeping pallor, announced the commencing day. =
Only the Corona, the Zodiacal light, a huge cone-shaped, luminous haze, poi=
nting up towards the splendour of the morning star, warned us of the immine=
nt nearness of the sun.</p>
			<p>Whatever light was about us was reflected by the westward cliffs. It =
showed a huge undulating plain, cold and grey, a grey that deepened eastwar=
d into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow. Innumerable rounded=
 grey summits, ghostly hummocks, billows of snowy substance, stretching cre=
st beyond crest into the remote obscurity, gave us our first inkling of the=
 distance of the crater wall. These hummocks looked like snow. At the time =
I thought they were snow. But they were not=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94they were moun=
ds and masses of frozen air!</p>
			<p>So it was at first, and then, sudden, swift, and amazing, came the lu=
nar day.</p>
			<p>The sunlight had crept down the cliff, it touched the drifted masses =
at its base and incontinently came striding with seven-leagued boots toward=
s us. The distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver, and at the touch of the=
 dawn a reek of grey vapour poured upward from the crater floor, whirls and=
 puffs and drifting wraiths of grey, thicker and broader and denser, until =
at last the whole westward plain was steaming like a wet handkerchief held =
before the fire, and the westward cliffs were no more than a refracted glar=
e beyond.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt is air,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=80=9CIt must be air=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94or it would not rise like this=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94at the mere =
touch of a sunbeam. And at this pace.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He peered upwards. =E2=80=9CLook!=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn the sky. Already. On the blackness=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a lit=
tle touch of blue. See! The stars seem larger. And the little ones and all =
those dim nebulosities we saw in empty space=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94they are hidd=
en!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Swiftly, steadily the day approached us. Grey summit after grey summi=
t was overtaken by the blaze, and turned to a smoking white intensity. At l=
ast there was nothing to the west of us but a bank of surging fog, the tumu=
ltuous advance and ascent of cloudy haze. The distant cliff had receded fur=
ther and further, had loomed and changed through the whirl, and foundered a=
nd vanished at last in its confusion.</p>
			<p>Nearer came that steaming advance, nearer and nearer, coming as fast =
as the shadow of a cloud before the southwest wind. About us rose a thin an=
ticipatory haze.</p>
			<p>Cavor gripped my arm.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat?=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook! The sunrise! The sun!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He turned me about and pointed to the brow of the eastward cliff, loo=
ming above the haze about us, scarce lighter than the darkness of the sky. =
But now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes, tongues of vermilion=
 flame that writhed and danced. I fancied it must be spirals of vapour that=
 had caught the light and made this crest of fiery tongues against the sky,=
 but indeed it was the solar prominences I saw, a crown of fire about the s=
un that is forever hidden from earthly eyes by our atmospheric veil.</p>
			<p>And then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the sun!</p>
			<p>Steadily, inevitably came a brilliant line, came a thin edge of intol=
erable effulgence that took a circular shape, became a bow, became a blazin=
g sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though it was a spear.</p>
			<p>It seemed verily to stab my eyes! I cried aloud and turned about blin=
ded, groping for my blanket beneath the bale.</p>
			<p>And with that incandescence came a sound, the first sound that had re=
ached us from without since we left the earth, a hissing and rustling, the =
stormy trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing day. And with the co=
ming of the sound and the light the sphere lurched, and blinded and dazzled=
 we staggered helplessly against each other. It lurched again, and the hiss=
ing grew louder. I had shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy efforts t=
o cover my head with my blanket, and this second lurch sent me helplessly o=
ff my feet. I fell against the bale, and opening my eyes had a momentary gl=
impse of the air just outside our glass. It was running=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it=
 was boiling=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94like snow into which a white-hot rod is thrus=
t. What had been solid air had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a pa=
ste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and bubbled into gas.</p>
			<p>There came a still more violent whirl of the sphere, and we had clutc=
hed one another. In another moment we were spun about again. Round we went =
and over, and then I was on all fours. The lunar dawn had hold of us. It me=
ant to show us little men what the moon could do with us.</p>
			<p>I caught a second glimpse of things without, puffs of vapour, half-li=
quid slush, excavated, sliding, falling, sliding. We dropped into darkness.=
 I went down with Cavor=E2=80=99s knees in my chest. Then he seemed to fly =
away from me, and for a moment I lay with all the breath out of my body sta=
ring upward. A toppling crag of the melting stuff had splashed over us, bur=
ied us, and now it thinned and boiled off us. I saw the bubbles dancing on =
the glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.</p>
			<p>Then some huge landslip in the thawing air had caught us, and splutte=
ring expostulation, we began to roll down a slope, rolling faster and faste=
r, leaping crevasses and rebounding from banks, faster and faster, westward=
 into the white-hot boiling tumult of the lunar day.</p>
			<p>Clutching at one another we spun about, pitched this way and that, ou=
r bale of packages leaping at us, pounding at us. We collided, we gripped, =
we were torn asunder=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94our heads met, and the whole universe=
 burst into fiery darts and stars! On the earth we should have smashed one =
another a dozen times, but on the moon, luckily for us, our weight was only=
 one-sixth of what it is terrestrially, and we fell very mercifully. I reca=
ll a sensation of utter sickness, a feeling as if my brain were upside down=
 within my skull, and then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Something was at work upon my face, some thin feelers worried my ears=
. Then I discovered the brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated by=
 blue spectacles. Cavor bent over me, and I saw his face upside down, his e=
yes also protected by tinted goggles. His breath came irregularly, and his =
lip was bleeding from a bruise. =E2=80=9CBetter?=E2=80=9D he said, wiping t=
he blood with the back of his hand.</p>
			<p>Everything seemed swaying for a space, but that was simply my giddine=
ss. I perceived that he had closed some of the shutters in the outer sphere=
 to save me from the direct blaze of the sun. I was aware that everything a=
bout us was very brilliant.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLord!=E2=80=9D I gasped. =E2=80=9CBut this=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=
!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I craned my neck to see. I perceived there was a blinding glare outsi=
de, an utter change from the gloomy darkness of our first impressions. =E2=
=80=9CHave I been insensible long?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the chronometer is bro=

have been afraid.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I lay for a space taking this in. I saw his face still bore evidences=
 of emotion. For a while I said nothing. I passed an inquisitive hand over =
my contusions, and surveyed his face for similar damages. The back of my ri=
ght hand had suffered most, and was skinless and raw. My forehead was bruis=
ed and had bled. He handed me a little measure with some of the restorative=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I forget the name of it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94he had brought w=
ith us. After a time I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs ca=
refully. Soon I could talk.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt wouldn=E2=80=99t have done,=E2=80=9D I said, as though th=
ere had been no interval.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo! it <em>wouldn=E2=80=99t</em>.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He thought, his hands hanging over his knees. He peered through the g=
lass and then stared at me. =E2=80=9CGood Lord!=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9C=
<em>No!</em>=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat has happened?=E2=80=9D I asked after a pause. =E2=80=9C=
Have we jumped to the tropics?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt was as I expected. This air has evaporated=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94if it is air. At any rate, it has evaporated and the surface of the moon=
 is showing. We are lying on a bank of earthy rock. Here and there bare soi=
l is exposed. A queer sort of soil!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>It occurred to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me=
 into a sitting position, and I could see with my own eyes.</p>

			<p>The harsh emphasis, the pitiless black and white of the scenery had a=
ltogether disappeared. The glare of the sun had taken upon itself a faint t=
inge of amber; the shadows upon the cliff of the crater wall were deeply pu=
rple. To the eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched and sheltered from =
the sunrise, but to the westward the sky was blue and clear. I began to rea=
lise the length of my insensibility.</p>
			<p>We were no longer in a void. An atmosphere had arisen about us. The o=
utline of things had gained in character, had grown acute and varied; save =
for a shadowed space of white substance here and there, white substance tha=
t was no longer air but snow, the arctic appearance had gone altogether. Ev=
erywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and tumbled earth spread to the b=
laze of the sun. Here and there at the edge of the snowdrifts were transien=
t little pools and eddies of water, the only things stirring in that expans=
e of barrenness. The sunlight inundated the upper two blinds of our sphere =
and turned our climate to high summer, but our feet were still in shadow, a=
nd the sphere was lying upon a drift of snow.</p>
			<p>And scattered here and there upon the slope, and emphasised by little=
 white threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like st=
icks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which they =
lay. That caught one=E2=80=99s thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless worl=
d? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their substance, I=
 perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous texture, like the car=
pet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade of pine trees.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt may be a dead world now=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94but once=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Something arrested my attention. I had discovered among these needles=
 a number of little round objects. And it seemed to me that one of these ha=
d moved.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I whispered.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>But I did not answer at once. I stared incredulous. For an instant I =
could not believe my eyes. I gave an inarticulate cry. I gripped his arm. I=
 pointed. =E2=80=9CLook!=E2=80=9D I cried, finding my tongue. =E2=80=9CTher=
e! Yes! And there!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>His eyes followed my pointing finger. =E2=80=9CEh?=E2=80=9D he said.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>How can I describe the thing I saw? It is so petty a thing to state, =
and yet it seemed so wonderful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said that =
amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded bodies, these little oval b=
odies that might have passed as very small pebbles. And now first one and t=
hen another had stirred, had rolled over and cracked, and down the crack of=
 each of them showed a minute line of yellowish green, thrusting outward to=
 meet the hot encouragement of the newly-risen sun. For a moment that was a=
ll, and then there stirred and burst a third!</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt is a seed,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. And then I heard him whis=
per very softly, =E2=80=9C<em>Life!</em>=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLife!=E2=80=9D And immediately it poured upon us that our va=
st journey had not been made in vain, that we had come to no arid waste of =
minerals, but to a world that lived and moved! We watched intensely. I reme=
mber I kept rubbing the glass before me with my sleeve, jealous of the fain=
test suspicion of mist.</p>
			<p>The picture was clear and vivid only in the middle of the field. All =
about that centre the dead fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by=
 the curvature of the glass. But we could see enough! One after another all=
 down the sunlit slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and gaped=
 apart, like seedpods, like the husks of fruits; opened eager mouths that d=
rank in the heat and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen sun.<!--
p-->
			</p><p>Every moment more of these seed coats ruptured, and even as they did =
so the swelling pioneers overflowed their rent-distended seedcases, and pas=
sed into the second stage of growth. With a steady assurance, a swift delib=
eration, these amazing seeds thrust a rootlet downward to the earth and a q=
ueer little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little while the whole slope=
 was dotted with minute plantlets standing at attention in the blaze of the=
 sun.</p>
			<p>They did not stand for long. The bundle-like buds swelled and straine=
d and opened with a jerk, thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips, spr=
eading a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that lengthened rapidly, le=
ngthened visibly even as we watched. The movement was slower than any anima=
l=E2=80=99s, swifter than any plant=E2=80=99s I have ever seen before. How =
can I suggest it to you=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the way that growth went on? The l=
eaf tips grew so that they moved onward even while we looked at them. The b=
rown seedcase shrivelled and was absorbed with an equal rapidity. Have you =
ever on a cold day taken a thermometer into your warm hand and watched the =
little thread of mercury creep up the tube? These moon plants grew like tha=
t.</p>
			<p>In a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the more forward of these=
 plants had lengthened into a stem and were even putting forth a second who=
rl of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so recently a lifeless stre=
tch of litter was now dark with the stunted olive-green herbage of bristlin=
g spikes that swayed with the vigour of their growing.</p>
			<p>I turned about, and behold! along the upper edge of a rock to the eas=
tward a similar fringe in a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent=
, dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And beyond this fringe was th=
e silhouette of a plant mass, branching clumsily like a cactus, and swellin=
g visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with air.</p>
			<p>Then to the westward also I discovered that another such distended fo=
rm was rising over the scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek sides,=
 and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange hue. It rose as one wat=
ched it; if one looked away from it for a minute and then back, its outline=
 had changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches until in a little time=
 it rose a coralline shape of many feet in height. Compared with such a gro=
wth the terrestrial puffball, which will sometimes swell a foot in diameter=
 in a single night, would be a hopeless laggard. But then the puffball grow=
s against a gravitational pull six times that of the moon. Beyond, out of g=
ullies and flats that had been hidden from us, but not from the quickening =
sun, over reefs and banks of shining rock, a bristling beard of spiky and f=
leshy vegetation was straining into view, hurrying tumultuously to take adv=
antage of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit and seed again an=
d die. It was like a miracle, that growth. So, one must imagine, the trees =
and plants arose at the Creation and covered the desolation of the new-made=
 earth.</p>
			<p>Imagine it! Imagine that dawn! The resurrection of the frozen air, th=
e stirring and quickening of the soil, and then this silent uprising of veg=
etation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and spikes. Conceive it all li=
t by a blaze that would make the intensest sunlight of earth seem watery an=
d weak. And still around this stirring jungle, wherever there was shadow, l=
ingered banks of bluish snow. And to have the picture of our impression com=
plete, you must bear in mind that we saw it all through a thick bent glass,=
 distorting it as things are distorted by a lens, acute only in the centre =
of the picture, and very bright there, and towards the edges magnified and =
unreal.</p>

			<p>We ceased to gaze. We turned to each other, the same thought, the sam=
e question in our eyes. For these plants to grow, there must be some air, h=
owever attenuated, air that we also should be able to breathe.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe manhole?=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes!=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=80=9Cif it is air we see!=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn a little while,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cthese plants wi=
ll be as high as we are. Suppose=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94suppose after all=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94Is it certain? How do you know that stuff is air? It may be nit=
rogen=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it may be carbonic acid even!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat is easy,=E2=80=9D he said, and set about proving it. He=
 produced a big piece of crumpled paper from the bale, lit it, and thrust i=
t hastily through the manhole valve. I bent forward and peered down through=
 the thick glass for its appearance outside, that little flame on whose evi=
dence depended so much!</p>
			<p>I saw the paper drop out and lie lightly upon the snow. The pink flam=
e of its burning vanished. For an instant it seemed to be extinguished. And=
 then I saw a little blue tongue upon the edge of it that trembled, and cre=
pt, and spread!</p>
			<p>Quietly the whole sheet, save where it lay in immediate contact with =
the snow, charred and shrivelled and sent up a quivering thread of smoke. T=
here was no doubt left to me; the atmosphere of the moon was either pure ox=
ygen or air, and capable therefore=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94unless its tenuity was =
excessive=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94of supporting our alien life. We might emerge=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94and live!</p>
			<p>I sat down with my legs on either side of the manhole and prepared to=
 unscrew it, but Cavor stopped me. =E2=80=9CThere is first a little precaut=
ion,=E2=80=9D he said. He pointed out that although it was certainly an oxy=
genated atmosphere outside, it might still be so rarified as to cause us gr=
ave injury. He reminded me of mountain sickness, and of the bleeding that o=
ften afflicts aeronauts who have ascended too swiftly, and he spent some ti=
me in the preparation of a sickly-tasting drink which he insisted on my sha=
ring. It made me feel a little numb, but otherwise had no effect on me. The=
n he permitted me to begin unscrewing.</p>
			<p>Presently the glass stopper of the manhole was so far undone that the=
 denser air within our sphere began to escape along the thread of the screw=
, singing as a kettle sings before it boils. Thereupon he made me desist. I=
t speedily became evident that the pressure outside was very much less than=
 it was within. How much less it was we had no means of telling.</p>
			<p>I sat grasping the stopper with both hands, ready to close it again i=
f, in spite of our intense hope, the lunar atmosphere should after all prov=
e too rarified for us, and Cavor sat with a cylinder of compressed oxygen a=
t hand to restore our pressure. We looked at one another in silence, and th=
en at the fantastic vegetation that swayed and grew visibly and noiselessly=
 without. And ever that shrill piping continued.</p>
			<p>My blood-vessels began to throb in my ears, and the sound of Cavor=E2=
=80=99s movements diminished. I noted how still everything had become, beca=
use of the thinning of the air.</p>
			<p>As our air sizzled out from the screw the moisture of it condensed in=
 little puffs.</p>
			<p>Presently I experienced a peculiar shortness of breath, that lasted i=
ndeed during the whole of the time of our exposure to the moon=E2=80=99s ex=
terior atmosphere, and a rather unpleasant sensation about the ears and fin=
gernails and the back of the throat grew upon my attention, and presently p=
assed off again.</p>
			<p>But then came vertigo and nausea that abruptly changed the quality of=
 my courage. I gave the lid of the manhole half a turn and made a hasty exp=
lanation to Cavor; but now he was the more sanguine. He answered me in a vo=
ice that seemed extraordinarily small and remote, because of the thinness o=
f the air that carried the sound. He recommended a nip of brandy, and set m=
e the example, and presently I felt better. I turned the manhole stopper ba=
ck again. The throbbing in my ears grew louder, and then I remarked that th=
e piping note of the outrush had ceased. For a time I could not be sure tha=
t it had ceased.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell?=E2=80=9D said Cavor in the ghost of a voice.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell?=E2=80=9D said I.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CShall we go on?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I thought. =E2=80=9CIs this all?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf you can stand it.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>By way of answer I went on unscrewing. I lifted the circular operculu=
m from its place and laid it carefully on the bale. A flake or so of snow w=
hirled and vanished as that thin and unfamiliar air took possession of our =
sphere. I knelt, and then seated myself at the edge of the manhole, peering=
 over it. Beneath, within a yard of my face, lay the untrodden snow of the =
moon.</p>
			<p>There came a little pause. Our eyes met.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt doesn=E2=80=99t distress your lungs too much?=E2=80=9D sa=
id Cavor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CI can stand this.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He stretched out his hand for his blanket, thrust his head through it=
s central hole and wrapped it about him. He sat down on the edge of the man=
hole, he let his feet drop until they were within six inches of the lunar g=
round. He hesitated for a moment, then thrust himself forward, dropped thes=
e intervening inches, and stood upon the untrodden soil of the moon.</p>
			<p>As he stepped forward he was refracted grotesquely by the edge of the=
 glass. He stood for a moment looking this way and that. Then he drew himse=
lf together and leapt.</p>
			<p>The glass distorted everything, but it seemed to me even then to be a=
n extremely big leap. He had at one bound become remote. He seemed twenty o=
r thirty feet off. He was standing high upon a rocky mass and gesticulating=
 back to me. Perhaps he was shouting=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94but the sound did not=
 reach me. But how the deuce had he done this? I felt like a man who has ju=
st seen a new conjuring trick.</p>
			<p>In a puzzled state of mind I too dropped through the manhole. I stood=
 up. Just in front of me the snowdrift had fallen away and made a sort of d=
itch. I made a step and jumped.</p>
			<p>I found myself flying through the air, saw the rock on which he stood=
 coming to meet me, clutched it and clung in a state of infinite amazement.=
</p>
			<p>I gasped a painful laugh. I was tremendously confused. Cavor bent dow=
n and shouted in piping tones for me to be careful.</p>
			<p>I had forgotten that on the moon, with only an eighth part of the ear=
th=E2=80=99s mass and a quarter of its diameter, my weight was barely a six=
th what it was on earth. But now that fact insisted on being remembered.
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CWe are out of Mother Earth=E2=80=99s leading-strings now,=E2=
=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>With a guarded effort I raised myself to the top, and moving as cauti=
ously as a rheumatic patient, stood up beside him under the blaze of the su=
n. The sphere lay behind us on its dwindling snowdrift thirty feet away.
			</p><p>As far as the eye could see over the enormous disorder of rocks that =
formed the crater floor, the same bristling scrub that surrounded us was st=
arting into life, diversified here and there by bulging masses of a cactus =
form, and scarlet and purple lichens that grew so fast they seemed to crawl=
 over the rocks. The whole area of the crater seemed to me then to be one s=
imilar wilderness up to the very foot of the surrounding cliff.</p>
			<p>This cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save at its base, and wi=
th buttresses and terraces and platforms that did not very greatly attract =
our attention at the time. It was many miles away from us in every directio=
n, we seemed to be almost at the centre of the crater, and we saw it throug=
h a certain haziness that drove before the wind. For there was even a wind =
now in the thin air, a swift yet weak wind that chilled exceedingly but exe=
rted little pressure. It was blowing round the crater, as it seemed, to the=
 hot illuminated side from the foggy darkness under the sunward wall. It wa=
s difficult to look into this eastward fog; we had to peer with half-closed=
 eyes beneath the shade of our hands, because of the fierce intensity of th=
e motionless sun.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt seems to be deserted,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=80=9Cabsol=
utely desolate.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked about me again. I retained even then a clinging hope of some=
 quasi-human evidence, some pinnacle of building, some house or engine, but=
 everywhere one looked spread the tumbled rocks in peaks and crests, and th=
e darting scrub and those bulging cacti that swelled and swelled, a flat ne=
gation as it seemed of all such hope.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt looks as though these plants had it to themselves,=E2=80=
=9D I said. =E2=80=9CI see no trace of any other creature.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo insects=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94no birds=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94no! No=
t a trace, not a scrap nor particle of animal life. If there was=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=94what would they do in the night?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=A6 No; there=E2=80=99s just these plants alone.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I shaded my eyes with my hand. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s like the landsca=
pe of a dream. These things are less like earthly land plants than the thin=
gs one imagines among the rocks at the bottom of the sea. Look at that yond=
er! One might imagine it a lizard changed into a plant. And the glare!=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThis is only the fresh morning,=E2=80=9D said Cavor.</p>
			<p>He sighed and looked about him. =E2=80=9CThis is no world for men,=E2=
=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CAnd yet in a way=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it appeals.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>He became silent for a time, then commenced his meditative humming.<!--
p-->
			</p><p>I started at a gentle touch, and found a thin sheet of livid lichen l=
apping over my shoe. I kicked at it and it fell to powder, and each speck b=
egan to grow.</p>
			<p>I heard Cavor exclaim sharply, and perceived that one of the fixed ba=
yonets of the scrub had pricked him.</p>
			<p>He hesitated, his eyes sought among the rocks about us. A sudden blaz=
e of pink had crept up a ragged pillar of crag. It was a most extraordinary=
 pink, a livid magenta.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook!=E2=80=9D said I, turning, and behold Cavor had vanishe=
d!</p>
			<p>For an instant I stood transfixed. Then I made a hasty step to look o=
ver the verge of the rock. But in my surprise at his disappearance I forgot=
 once more that we were on the moon. The thrust of my foot that I made in s=
triding would have carried me a yard on earth; on the moon it carried me si=
x=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a good five yards over the edge. For the moment the thin=
g had something of the effect of those nightmares when one falls and falls.=
 For while one falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on earth, o=
n the moon one falls two, and with only a sixth of one=E2=80=99s weight. I =
fell, or rather I jumped down, about ten yards I suppose. It seemed to take=
 quite a long time, five or six seconds, I should think. I floated through =
the air and fell like a feather, knee-deep in a snowdrift in the bottom of =
a gully of blue-grey, white-veined rock.</p>
			<p>I looked about me. =E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I cried; but no Cavor was=
 visible.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I cried louder, and the rocks echoed me.</p>
			<p>I turned fiercely to the rocks and clambered to the summit of them. =
=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I cried. My voice sounded like the voice of a lost=
 lamb.</p>
			<p>The sphere, too, was not in sight, and for a moment a horrible feelin=
g of desolation pinched my heart.</p>
			<p>Then I saw him. He was laughing and gesticulating to attract my atten=
tion. He was on a bare patch of rock twenty or thirty yards away. I could n=
ot hear his voice, but =E2=80=9Cjump=E2=80=9D said his gestures. I hesitate=
d, the distance seemed enormous. Yet I reflected that surely I must be able=
 to clear a greater distance than Cavor.</p>
			<p>I made a step back, gathered myself together, and leapt with all my m=
ight. I seemed to shoot right up in the air as though I should never come d=
own.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>It was horrible and delightful, and as wild as a nightmare, to go fly=
ing off in this fashion. I realised my leap had been altogether too violent=
. I flew clean over Cavor=E2=80=99s head and beheld a spiky confusion in a =
gully spreading to meet my fall. I gave a yelp of alarm. I put out my hands=
 and straightened my legs.</p>
			<p>I hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst all about me, scattering a mass =
of orange spores in every direction, and covering me with orange powder. I =
rolled over spluttering, and came to rest convulsed with breathless laughte=
r.</p>
			<p>I became aware of Cavor=E2=80=99s little round face peering over a br=
istling hedge. He shouted some faded inquiry. =E2=80=9CEh?=E2=80=9D I tried=
 to shout, but could not do so for want of breath. He made his way towards =
me, coming gingerly among the bushes.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve got to be careful,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9C=
This moon has no discipline. She=E2=80=99ll let us smash ourselves.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>He helped me to my feet. =E2=80=9CYou exerted yourself too much,=E2=
=80=9D he said, dabbing at the yellow stuff with his hand to remove it from=
 my garments.</p>
			<p>I stood passive and panting, allowing him to beat off the jelly from =
my knees and elbows and lecture me upon my misfortunes. =E2=80=9CWe don=E2=
=80=99t quite allow for the gravitation. Our muscles are scarcely educated =
yet. We must practise a little, when you have got your breath.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I pulled two or three little thorns out of my hand, and sat for a tim=
e on a boulder of rock. My muscles were quivering, and I had that feeling o=
f personal disillusionment that comes at the first fall to the learner of c=
ycling on earth.</p>
			<p>It suddenly occurred to Cavor that the cold air in the gully, after t=
he brightness of the sun, might give me a fever. So we clambered back into =
the sunlight. We found that beyond a few abrasions I had received no seriou=
s injuries from my tumble, and at Cavor=E2=80=99s suggestion we were presen=
tly looking round for some safe and easy landing-place for my next leap. We=
 chose a rocky slab some ten yards off, separated from us by a little thick=
et of olive-green spikes.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CImagine it there!=E2=80=9D said Cavor, who was assuming the =
airs of a trainer, and he pointed to a spot about four feet from my toes. T=
his leap I managed without difficulty, and I must confess I found a certain=
 satisfaction in Cavor=E2=80=99s falling short by a foot or so and tasting =
the spikes of the scrub. =E2=80=9COne has to be careful, you see,=E2=80=9D =
he said, pulling out his thorns, and with that he ceased to be my Mentor, a=
nd became my fellow learner in the art of lunar locomotion.</p>
			<p>We chose a still easier jump and did it without difficulty, and then =
leapt back again, and to and fro several times, accustoming our muscles to =
the new standard. I could never have believed had I not experienced it, how=
 rapid that adaptation would be. In a very little time indeed, certainly af=
ter fewer than thirty leaps, we could judge the effort necessary for a dist=
ance with almost terrestrial assurance.</p>
			<p>And all this time the lunar plants were growing around us, higher and=
 denser and more entangled, every moment thicker and taller, spiked plants,=
 green cactus masses, fungi, fleshy and lichenous things, strangest radiate=
 and sinuous shapes. But we were so intent upon our leaping, that for a tim=
e we gave no heed to their unfaltering expansion.</p>
			<p>An extraordinary elation had taken possession of us. Partly, I think,=
 it was our sense of release from the confinement of the sphere. Mainly, ho=
wever, the thin sweetness of the air, which I am certain contained a much l=
arger proportion of oxygen than our terrestrial atmosphere. In spite of the=
 strange quality of all about us, I felt as adventurous and experimental as=
 a cockney would do placed for the first time among mountains; and I do not=
 think it occurred to either of us, face to face though we were with the Un=
known, to be very greatly afraid.</p>
			<p>We were bitten by a spirit of enterprise. We selected a lichenous kop=
je perhaps fifteen yards away, and landed neatly on its summit one after th=
e other. =E2=80=9CGood!=E2=80=9D we cried to each other; =E2=80=9Cgood!=E2=
=80=9D and Cavor made three steps and went off to a tempting slope of snow =
a good twenty yards and more beyond. I stood for a moment struck by the gro=
tesque effect of his soaring figure=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94his dirty cricket cap,=
 and spiky hair, his little round body, his arms and his knickerbockered le=
gs tucked up tightly=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94against the weird spaciousness of the=
 lunar scene. A gust of laughter seized me, and then I stepped off to follo=
w. Plump! I dropped beside him.</p>
			<p>We made a few gargantuan strides, leapt three or four times more, and=
 sat down at last in a lichenous hollow. Our lungs were painful. We sat hol=
ding our sides and recovering our breath, looking appreciation at one anoth=
er. Cavor panted something about =E2=80=9Camazing sensations.=E2=80=9D And =
then came a thought into my head. For the moment it did not seem a particul=
arly appalling thought, simply a natural question arising out of the situat=
ion.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBy the way,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cwhere exactly is the s=

			<p>His face caught something of my dismay. He stood up and stared about =
him at the scrub that fenced us in and rose about us, straining upward in a=
 passion of growth. He put a dubious hand to his lips. He spoke with a sudd=
en lack of assurance. =E2=80=9CI think,=E2=80=9D he said slowly, =E2=80=9Cw=

pened. =E2=80=9CAnyhow,=E2=80=9D he said, with his eyes on me, =E2=80=9Cit =
can=E2=80=99t be far.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We had both stood up. We made unmeaning ejaculations, our eyes sought=
 in the twining, thickening jungle round about us.</p>
			<p>All about us on the sunlit slopes frothed and swayed the darting shru=
bs, the swelling cactus, the creeping lichens, and wherever the shade remai=
ned the snowdrifts lingered. North, south, east, and west spread an identic=
al monotony of unfamiliar forms. And somewhere, buried already among this t=
angled confusion, was our sphere, our home, our only provision, our only ho=
pe of escape from this fantastic wilderness of ephemeral growths into which=
 we had come.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI think, after all,=E2=80=9D he said, pointing suddenly, =E2=
=80=9Cit might be over there.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CWe have turned in a curve. See=

			<p>We stared into one another=E2=80=99s eyes. The area of the crater had=
 become enormously vast to our imaginations, the growing thickets already i=
mpenetrably dense.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGood heavens! What fools we have been!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s evident that we must find it again,=E2=80=9D sa=

=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 I=E2=80=99m hungry.=E2=80=9D</p>

. But it came to me at once=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a positive craving. =E2=80=9CY=
es,=E2=80=9D I said with emphasis. =E2=80=9CI am hungry too.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He stood up with a look of active resolution. =E2=80=9CCertainly we m=
ust find the sphere.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>As calmly as possible we surveyed the interminable reefs and thickets=
 that formed the floor of the crater, each of us weighing in silence the ch=
ances of our finding the sphere before we were overtaken by heat and hunger=
.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt can=E2=80=99t be fifty yards from here,=E2=80=9D said Cav=
or, with indecisive gestures. =E2=80=9CThe only thing is to beat round abou=
t until we come upon it.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat is all we can do,=E2=80=9D I said, without any alacrity=
 to begin our hunt. =E2=80=9CI wish this confounded spike bush did not grow=
 so fast!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s just it,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=80=9CBut it=
 <em>was</em> lying on a bank of snow.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I stared about me in the vain hope of recognising some knoll or shrub=
 that had been near the sphere. But everywhere was a confusing sameness, ev=
erywhere the aspiring bushes, the distending fungi, the dwindling snow bank=
s, steadily and inevitably changed. The sun scorched and stung, the faintne=
ss of an unaccountable hunger mingled with our infinite perplexity. And eve=
n as we stood there, confused and lost amidst unprecedented things, we beca=
me aware for the first time of a sound upon the moon other than the stir of=
 the growing plants, the faint sighing of the wind, or those that we oursel=
ves had made.</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>It came from beneath our feet, a sound in the earth. We seemed to hea=
r it with our feet as much as with our ears. Its dull resonance was muffled=
 by distance, thick with the quality of intervening substance. No sound tha=
t I can imagine could have astonished us more, or have changed more complet=
ely the quality of things about us. For this sound, rich, slow, and deliber=
ate, seemed to us as though it could be nothing but the striking of some gi=
gantic buried clock.</p>
			<p>

			<p>Sound suggestive of still cloisters, of sleepless nights in crowded c=
ities, of vigils and the awaited hour, of all that is orderly and methodica=
l in life, booming out pregnant and mysterious in this fantastic desert! To=
 the eye everything was unchanged: the desolation of bushes and cacti wavin=
g silently in the wind, stretched unbroken to the distant cliffs, the still=
 dark sky was empty overhead, and the hot sun hung and burned. And through =
it all, a warning, a threat, throbbed this enigma of sound.</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CCount,=E2=80=9D was Cavor=E2=80=99s belated suggestion, and =
at that word the striking ceased.</p>
			<p>The silence, the rhythmic disappointment of the silence, came as a fr=
esh shock. For a moment one could doubt whether one had ever heard a sound.=
 Or whether it might not still be going on. Had I indeed heard a sound?</p>
			<p>I felt the pressure of Cavor=E2=80=99s hand upon my arm. He spoke in =
an undertone, as though he feared to wake some sleeping thing. =E2=80=9CLet=
 us keep together,=E2=80=9D he whispered, =E2=80=9Cand look for the sphere.=
 We must get back to the sphere. This is beyond our understanding.=E2=80=9D=
</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhich way shall we go?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He hesitated. An intense persuasion of presences, of unseen things ab=
out us and near us, dominated our minds. What could they be? Where could th=
ey be? Was this arid desolation, alternately frozen and scorched, only the =
outer rind and mask of some subterranean world? And if so, what sort of wor=
ld? What sort of inhabitants might it not presently disgorge upon us?</p>
			<p>And then, stabbing the aching stillness as vivid and sudden as an une=
xpected thunderclap, came a clang and rattle as though great gates of metal=
 had suddenly been flung apart.</p>
			<p>It arrested our steps. We stood gaping helplessly. Then Cavor stole t=
owards me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI do not understand!=E2=80=9D he whispered close to my face.=
 He waved his hand vaguely skyward, the vague suggestion of still vaguer th=
oughts.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CA hiding-place! If anything came.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked about us. I nodded my head in assent to him.</p>
			<p>We started off, moving stealthily with the most exaggerated precautio=
ns against noise. We went towards a thicket of scrub. A clangour like hamme=
rs flung about a boiler hastened our steps. =E2=80=9CWe must crawl,=E2=80=
=9D whispered Cavor.</p>
			<p>The lower leaves of the bayonet plants, already overshadowed by the n=
ewer ones above, were beginning to wilt and shrivel so that we could thrust=
 our way in among the thickening stems without serious injury. A stab in th=
e face or arm we did not heed. At the heart of the thicket I stopped, and s=
tared panting into Cavor=E2=80=99s face.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSubterranean,=E2=80=9D he whispered. =E2=80=9CBelow.=E2=80=

			<p>=E2=80=9CWe must find the sphere!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D I said; =E2=80=9Cbut how?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCrawl till we come to it.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut if we don=E2=80=99t?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CKeep hidden. See what they are like.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe will keep together,=E2=80=9D said I.</p>
			<p>He thought. =E2=80=9CWhich way shall we go?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe must take our chance.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We peered this way and that. Then very circumspectly, we began to cra=
wl through the lower jungle, making, so far as we could judge, a circuit, h=
alting now at every waving fungus, at every sound, intent only on the spher=
e from which we had so foolishly emerged. Ever and again from out of the ea=
rth beneath us came concussions, beatings, strange, inexplicable, mechanica=
l sounds; and once, and then again, we thought we heard something, a faint =
rattle and tumult, borne to us through the air. But fearful as we were we d=
ared essay no vantage-point to survey the crater. For long we saw nothing o=
f the beings whose sounds were so abundant and insistent. But for the faint=
ness of our hunger and the drying of our throats that crawling would have h=
ad the quality of a very vivid dream. It was so absolutely unreal. The only=
 element with any touch of reality was these sounds.</p>
			<p>Figure it to yourself! About us the dreamlike jungle, with the silent=
 bayonet leaves darting overhead, and the silent, vivid, sun-splashed liche=
ns under our hands and knees, waving with the vigour of their growth as a c=
arpet waves when the wind gets beneath it. Ever and again one of the bladde=
r fungi, bulging and distending under the sun, loomed upon us. Ever and aga=
in some novel shape in vivid colour obtruded. The very cells that built up =
these plants were as large as my thumb, like beads of coloured glass. And a=
ll these things were saturated in the unmitigated glare of the sun, were se=
en against a sky that was bluish black and spangled still, in spite of the =
sunlight, with a few surviving stars. Strange! the very forms and texture o=
f the stones were strange. It was all strange, the feeling of one=E2=80=99s=
 body was unprecedented, every other movement ended in a surprise. The brea=
th sucked thin in one=E2=80=99s throat, the blood flowed through one=E2=80=

beasts!</p>

				<p epub:type="3D&quot;title&quot;">The Mooncalf Pastures</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>So we two poor terrestrial castaways, lost in that wild-growing moon =
jungle, crawled in terror before the sounds that had come upon us. We crawl=
ed, as it seemed, a long time before we saw either Selenite or mooncalf, th=
ough we heard the bellowing and gruntulous noises of these latter continual=
ly drawing nearer to us. We crawled through stony ravines, over snow slopes=
, amidst fungi that ripped like thin bladders at our thrust, emitting a wat=
ery humour, over a perfect pavement of things like puffballs, and beneath i=
nterminable thickets of scrub. And ever more hopelessly our eyes sought for=
 our abandoned sphere. The noise of the mooncalves would at times be a vast=
 flat calf-like sound, at times it rose to an amazed and wrathy bellowing, =
and again it would become a clogged bestial sound, as though these unseen c=
reatures had sought to eat and bellow at the same time.</p>
			<p>Our first view was but an inadequate transitory glimpse, yet none the=
 less disturbing because it was incomplete. Cavor was crawling in front at =
the time, and he first was aware of their proximity. He stopped dead, arres=
ting me with a single gesture.</p>
			<p>A crackling and smashing of the scrub appeared to be advancing direct=
ly upon us, and then, as we squatted close and endeavoured to judge of the =
nearness and direction of this noise, there came a terrific bellow behind u=
s, so close and vehement that the tops of the bayonet scrub bent before it,=
 and one felt the breath of it hot and moist. And, turning about, we saw in=
distinctly through a crowd of swaying stems the mooncalf=E2=80=99s shining =
sides, and the long line of its back loomed out against the sky.</p>
			<p>Of course it is hard for me now to say how much I saw at that time, b=
ecause my impressions were corrected by subsequent observation. First of al=
l impressions was its enormous size; the girth of its body was some foursco=
re feet, its length perhaps two hundred. Its sides rose and fell with its l=
aboured breathing. I perceived that its gigantic, flabby body lay along the=
 ground, and that its skin was of a corrugated white, dappling into blackne=
ss along the backbone. But of its feet we saw nothing. I think also that we=
 saw then the profile at least of the almost brainless head, with its fat-e=
ncumbered neck, its slobbering omnivorous mouth, its little nostrils, and t=
ight shut eyes. (For the mooncalf invariably shuts its eyes in the presence=
 of the sun.) We had a glimpse of a vast red pit as it opened its mouth to =
bleat and bellow again; we had a breath from the pit, and then the monster =
heeled over like a ship, dragged forward along the ground, creasing all its=
 leathery skin, rolled again, and so wallowed past us, smashing a path amid=
st the scrub, and was speedily hidden from our eyes by the dense interlacin=
gs beyond. Another appeared more distantly, and then another, and then, as =
though he was guiding these animated lumps of provender to their pasture, a=
 Selenite came momentarily into ken. My grip upon Cavor=E2=80=99s foot beca=
me convulsive at the sight of him, and we remained motionless and peering l=
ong after he had passed out of our range.</p>
			<p>By contrast with the mooncalves he seemed a trivial being, a mere ant=
, scarcely five feet high. He was wearing garments of some leathery substan=
ce, so that no portion of his actual body appeared, but of this, of course,=
 we were entirely ignorant. He presented himself, therefore, as a compact, =
bristling creature, having much of the quality of a complicated insect, wit=
h whip-like tentacles and a clanging arm projecting from his shining cylind=
rical body case. The form of his head was hidden by his enormous many-spike=
d helmet=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94we discovered afterwards that he used the spikes =
for prodding refractory mooncalves=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and a pair of goggles o=
f darkened glass, set very much at the side, gave a birdlike quality to the=
 metallic apparatus that covered his face. His arms did not project beyond =
his body case, and he carried himself upon short legs that, wrapped though =
they were in warm coverings, seemed to our terrestrial eyes inordinately fl=
imsy. They had very short thighs, very long shanks, and little feet.</p>
			<p>In spite of his heavy-looking clothing, he was progressing with what =
would be, from the terrestrial point of view, very considerable strides, an=
d his clanging arm was busy. The quality of his motion during the instant o=
f his passing suggested haste and a certain anger, and soon after we had lo=
st sight of him we heard the bellow of a mooncalf change abruptly into a sh=
ort, sharp squeal, followed by the scuffle of its acceleration. And gradual=
ly that bellowing receded, and then came to an end, as if the pastures soug=
ht had been attained.</p>
			<p>We listened. For a space the moon world was still. But it was some ti=
me before we resumed our crawling search for the vanished sphere.</p>
			<p>When next we saw mooncalves they were some little distance away from =
us in a place of tumbled rocks. The less vertical surfaces of the rocks wer=
e thick with a speckled green plant growing in dense mossy clumps, upon whi=
ch these creatures were browsing. We stopped at the edge of the reeds amids=
t which we were crawling at the sight of them, peering out at them and look=
ing round for a second glimpse of a Selenite. They lay against their food l=
ike stupendous slugs, huge, greasy hulls, eating greedily and noisily, with=
 a sort of sobbing avidity. They seemed monsters of mere fatness, clumsy an=
d overwhelmed to a degree that would make a Smithfield ox seem a model of a=
gility. Their busy, writhing, chewing mouths, and eyes closed, together wit=
h the appetising sound of their munching, made up an effect of animal enjoy=
ment that was singularly stimulating to our empty frames.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHogs!=E2=80=9D said Cavor with unusual passion. =E2=80=9CDis=
gusting hogs!=E2=80=9D and after one glare of angry envy crawled off throug=
h the bushes to our right. I stayed long enough to see that the speckled pl=
ant was quite hopeless for human nourishment, then crawled after him, nibbl=
ing a quill of it between my teeth.</p>
			<p>Presently we were arrested again by the proximity of a Selenite, and =
this time we were able to observe him more exactly. Now we could see that t=
he Selenite covering was indeed clothing, and not a sort of crustacean inte=
gument. He was quite similar in his costume to the former one we had glimps=
ed, except that ends of something like wadding were protruding from his nec=
k, and he stood on a promontory of rock and moved his head this way and tha=
t, as though he was surveying the crater. We lay quite still, fearing to at=
tract his attention if we moved, and after a time he turned about and disap=
peared.</p>
			<p>We came upon another drove of mooncalves bellowing up a ravine, and t=
hen we passed over a place of sounds, sounds of beating machinery, as if so=
me huge hall of industry came near the surface there. And while these sound=
s were still about us we came to the edge of a great open space, perhaps tw=
o hundred yards in diameter, and perfectly level. Save for a few lichens th=
at advanced from its margin this space was bare, and presented a powdery su=
rface of a dusty yellow colour. We were afraid to strike out across this sp=
ace, but as it presented less obstruction to our crawling than the scrub, w=
e went down upon it and began very circumspectly to skirt its edge.</p>
			<p>For a little while the noises from below ceased, and everything, save=
 for the faint stir of the growing vegetation, was very still. Then abruptl=
y there began an uproar, louder, more vehement, and nearer than any we had =
so far heard. Of a certainty it came from below. Instinctively we crouched =
as flat as we could, ready for a prompt plunge into the thicket beside us. =
Each knock and throb seemed to vibrate through our bodies. Louder grew this=
 throbbing and beating, and that irregular vibration increased until the wh=
ole moon world seemed to be jerking and pulsing.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCover,=E2=80=9D whispered Cavor, and I turned towards the bu=
shes.</p>
			<p>At that instant came a thud like the thud of a gun, and then a thing =
happened=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it still haunts me in my dreams. I had turned my =
head to look at Cavor=E2=80=99s face, and thrust out my hand in front of me=
 as I did so. And my hand met nothing! Plunged suddenly into a bottomless h=
ole!</p>
			<p>My chest hit something hard, and I found myself with my chin on the e=
dge of an unfathomable abyss that had suddenly opened beneath me, my hand e=
xtended stiffly into the void. The whole of that flat circular area was no =
more than a gigantic lid, that was now sliding sideways from off the pit it=
 had covered into a slot prepared for it.</p>
			<p>Had it not been for Cavor I think I should have remained rigid, hangi=
ng over this margin and staring into the enormous gulf below, until at last=
 the edges of the slot scraped me off and hurled me into its depths. But Ca=
vor had not received the shock that had paralysed me. He had been a little =
distance from the edge when the lid had first opened, and perceiving the pe=
ril that held me helpless, gripped my legs and pulled me backward. I came i=
nto a sitting position, crawled away from the edge for a space on all fours=
, then staggered up and ran after him across the thundering, quivering shee=
t of metal. It seemed to be swinging open with a steadily accelerated veloc=
ity, and the bushes in front of me shifted sideways as I ran.</p>
			<p>I was none too soon. Cavor=E2=80=99s back vanished amidst the bristli=
ng thicket, and as I scrambled up after him, the monstrous valve came into =
its position with a clang. For a long time we lay panting, not daring to ap=
proach the pit.</p>
			<p>But at last very cautiously and bit by bit we crept into a position f=
rom which we could peer down. The bushes about us creaked and waved with th=
e force of a breeze that was blowing down the shaft. We could see nothing a=
t first except smooth vertical walls descending at last into an impenetrabl=
e black. And then very gradually we became aware of a number of very faint =
and little lights going to and fro.</p>
			<p>For a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held us so that we forgot =
even our sphere. In time, as we grew more accustomed to the darkness, we co=
uld make out very small, dim, elusive shapes moving about among those needl=
epoint illuminations. We peered amazed and incredulous, understanding so li=
ttle that we could find no words to say. We could distinguish nothing that =
would give us a clue to the meaning of the faint shapes we saw.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat can it be?=E2=80=9D I asked; =E2=80=9Cwhat can it be?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe engineering!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 They mu=
st live in these caverns during the night, and come out during the day.=E2=

			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CCan they be=E2=81=A0=E2=80=

			<p>=E2=80=9CWe can do nothing until we find the sphere.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He assented with a groan and stirred himself to move. He stared about=
 him for a space, sighed, and indicated a direction. We struck out through =
the jungle. For a time we crawled resolutely, then with diminishing vigour.=
 Presently among great shapes of flabby purple there came a noise of trampl=
ing and cries about us. We lay close, and for a long time the sounds went t=
o and fro and very near. But this time we saw nothing. I tried to whisper t=

			<p>I gnawed my hand.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe sphere!=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CThere is nothing for =
it but the sphere.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We roused ourselves to another spurt of crawling. My mind ran entirel=
y on edible things, on the hissing profundity of summer drinks, more partic=
ularly I craved for beer. I was haunted by the memory of a sixteen gallon c=
ask that had swaggered in my Lympne cellar. I thought of the adjacent larde=
r, and especially of steak and kidney pie=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94tender steak and=
 plenty of kidney, and rich, thick gravy between. Ever and again I was seiz=
ed with fits of hungry yawning. We came to flat places overgrown with flesh=
y red things, monstrous coralline growths; as we pushed against them they s=
napped and broke. I noted the quality of the broken surfaces. The confounde=
d stuff certainly looked of a biteable texture. Then it seemed to me that i=
t smelt rather well.</p>
			<p>I picked up a fragment and sniffed at it.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I said in a hoarse undertone.</p>
			<p>He glanced at me with his face screwed up. =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t,=E2=
=80=9D he said. I put down the fragment, and we crawled on through this tem=
pting fleshiness for a space.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I asked, =E2=80=9Cwhy <em>not</em>?=E2=80=9D=
</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPoison,=E2=80=9D I heard him say, but he did not look round.=
</p>
			<p>We crawled some way before I decided.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll chance it,=E2=80=9D said I.</p>
			<p>He made a belated gesture to prevent me. I stuffed my mouth full. He =
crouched watching my face, his own twisted into the oddest expression. =E2=
=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s good,=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CO Lord!=E2=80=9D he cried.</p>
			<p>He watched me munch, his face wrinkled between desire and disapproval=
, then suddenly succumbed to appetite, and began to tear off huge mouthfuls=
. For a time we did nothing but eat.</p>
			<p>The stuff was not unlike a terrestrial mushroom, only it was much lax=
er in texture, and, as one swallowed it, it warmed the throat. At first we =
experienced a mere mechanical satisfaction in eating; then our blood began =
to run warmer, and we tingled at the lips and fingers, and then new and sli=
ghtly irrelevant ideas came bubbling up in our minds.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s good,=E2=80=9D said I. =E2=80=9CInfernally good=
! What a home for our surplus population! Our poor surplus population,=E2=
=80=9D and I broke off another large portion.</p>
			<p>It filled me with a curiously benevolent satisfaction that there was =
such good food in the moon. The depression of my hunger gave way to an irra=
tional exhilaration. The dread and discomfort in which I had been living va=
nished entirely. I perceived the moon no longer as a planet from which I mo=
st earnestly desired the means of escape, but as a possible refuge for huma=
n destitution. I think I forgot the Selenites, the mooncalves, the lid, and=
 the noises completely so soon as I had eaten that fungus.</p>
			<p>Cavor replied to my third repetition of my =E2=80=9Csurplus populatio=
n=E2=80=9D remark with similar words of approval. I felt that my head swam,=
 but I put this down to the stimulating effect of food after a long fast. =
=E2=80=9CEss=E2=80=99lent discov=E2=80=99ry yours, Cavor,=E2=80=9D said I. =

=E2=80=99tato?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked at him, shocked at his suddenly hoarse voice, and by the bad=
ness of his articulation. It occurred to me in a flash that he was intoxica=
ted, possibly by the fungus. It also occurred to me that he erred in imagin=
ing that he had discovered the moon; he had not discovered it, he had only =
reached it. I tried to lay my hand on his arm and explain this to him, but =
the issue was too subtle for his brain. It was also unexpectedly difficult =
to express. After a momentary attempt to understand me=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I r=
emember wondering if the fungus had made my eyes as fishy as his=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=94he set off upon some observations on his own account.</p>

=9Cthe creashurs o=E2=80=99 what we eat and drink.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He repeated this, and as I was now in one of my subtle moods, I deter=
mined to dispute it. Possibly I wandered a little from the point. But Cavor=
 certainly did not attend at all properly. He stood up as well as he could,=
 putting a hand on my head to steady himself, which was disrespectful, and =
stood staring about him, quite devoid now of any fear of the moon beings.<!--
p-->
			</p><p>I tried to point out that this was dangerous for some reason that was=
 not perfectly clear to me, but the word =E2=80=9Cdangerous=E2=80=9D had so=
mehow got mixed with =E2=80=9Cindiscreet,=E2=80=9D and came out rather more=
 like =E2=80=9Cinjurious=E2=80=9D than either; and after an attempt to dise=
ntangle them, I resumed my argument, addressing myself principally to the u=
nfamiliar but attentive coralline growths on either side. I felt that it wa=
s necessary to clear up this confusion between the moon and a potato at onc=
e=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I wandered into a long parenthesis on the importance of =
precision of definition in argument. I did my best to ignore the fact that =
my bodily sensations were no longer agreeable.</p>
			<p>In some way that I have now forgotten, my mind was led back to projec=
ts of colonisation. =E2=80=9CWe must annex this moon,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=
=80=9CThere must be no shilly-shally. This is part of the White Man=E2=80=
=99s Burden. Cavor=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94we are=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94<em>hic</em>=E2=

ited! Practically.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Certainly I was intoxicated.</p>
			<p>I embarked upon an argument to show the infinite benefits our arrival=
 would confer on the moon. I involved myself in a rather difficult proof th=
at the arrival of Columbus was, on the whole, beneficial to America. I foun=
d I had forgotten the line of argument I had intended to pursue, and contin=
ued to repeat =E2=80=9CSimlar to C=E2=80=99lumbus,=E2=80=9D to fill up time=
.</p>
			<p>From that point my memory of the action of that abominable fungus bec=
omes confused. I remember vaguely that we declared our intention of standin=
g no nonsense from any confounded insects, that we decided it ill became me=
n to hide shamefully upon a mere satellite, that we equipped ourselves with=
 huge armfuls of the fungus=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94whether for missile purposes o=
r not I do not know=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and, heedless of the stabs of the bayo=
net scrub, we started forth into the sunshine.</p>
			<p>Almost immediately we must have come upon the Selenites. There were s=
ix of them, and they were marching in single file over a rocky place, makin=
g the most remarkable piping and whining sounds. They all seemed to become =
aware of us at once, all instantly became silent and motionless, like anima=
ls, with their faces turned towards us.</p>
			<p>For a moment I was sobered.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CInsects,=E2=80=9D murmured Cavor, =E2=80=9Cinsects! And they=
 think I=E2=80=99m going to crawl about on my stomach=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94on m=
y vertebrated stomach!</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CStomach,=E2=80=9D he repeated slowly, as though he chewed th=
e indignity.</p>
			<p>Then suddenly, with a shout of fury, he made three vast strides and l=
eapt towards them. He leapt badly; he made a series of somersaults in the a=
ir, whirled right over them, and vanished with an enormous splash amidst th=
e cactus bladders. What the Selenites made of this amazing, and to my mind =
undignified irruption from another planet, I have no means of guessing. I s=
eem to remember the sight of their backs as they ran in all directions, but=
 I am not sure. All these last incidents before oblivion came are vague and=
 faint in my mind. I know I made a step to follow Cavor, and tripped and fe=
ll headlong among the rocks. I was, I am certain, suddenly and vehemently i=
ll. I seem to remember a violent struggle, and being gripped by metallic cl=
asps.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<hr>
			<p>My next clear recollection is that we were prisoners at we knew not w=
hat depth beneath the moon=E2=80=99s surface; we were in darkness amidst st=
range distracting noises; our bodies were covered with scratches and bruise=
s, and our heads racked with pain.</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>I found myself sitting crouched together in a tumultuous darkness. Fo=
r a long time I could not understand where I was, nor how I had come to thi=
s perplexity. I thought of the cupboard into which I had been thrust at tim=
es when I was a child, and then of a very dark and noisy bedroom in which I=
 had slept during an illness. But these sounds about me were not the noises=
 I had known, and there was a thin flavour in the air like the wind of a st=
able. Then I supposed we must still be at work upon the sphere, and that so=
mehow I had got into the cellar of Cavor=E2=80=99s house. I remembered we h=
ad finished the sphere, and fancied I must still be in it and travelling th=
rough space.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Ccannot we have some light?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>There came no answer.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I insisted.</p>
			<p>I was answered by a groan. =E2=80=9CMy head!=E2=80=9D I heard him say=
; =E2=80=9Cmy head!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I attempted to press my hands to my brow, which ached, and discovered=
 they were tied together. This startled me very much. I brought them up to =
my mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal. They were chained together.=
 I tried to separate my legs, and made out they were similarly fastened, an=
d also that I was fastened to the ground by a much thicker chain about the =
middle of my body.</p>
			<p>I was more frightened than I had yet been by anything in all our stra=
nge experiences. For a time I tugged silently at my bonds. =E2=80=9CCavor!=
=E2=80=9D I cried out sharply. =E2=80=9CWhy am I tied? Why have you tied me=
 hand and foot?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI haven=E2=80=99t tied you,=E2=80=9D he answered. =E2=80=9CI=
t=E2=80=99s the Selenites.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>The Selenites! My mind hung on that for a space. Then my memories cam=
e back to me: the snowy desolation, the thawing of the air, the growth of t=
he plants, our strange hopping and crawling among the rocks and vegetation =
of the crater. All the distress of our frantic search for the sphere return=
ed to me.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Finally the opening of the gr=
eat lid that covered the pit!</p>
			<p>Then as I strained to trace our later movements down to our present p=
light, the pain in my head became intolerable. I came to an insurmountable =
barrier, an obstinate blank.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhere are we?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow should I know?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAre we dead?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat nonsense!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99ve got us, then!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He made no answer but a grunt. The lingering traces of the poison see=
med to make him oddly irritable.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat do you mean to do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow should I know what to do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COh, very well!=E2=80=9D said I, and became silent. Presently=
 I was roused from a stupor. =E2=80=9CO <em>Lord</em>!=E2=80=9D I cried; =
=E2=80=9CI wish you=E2=80=99d stop that buzzing!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We lapsed into silence again, listening to the dull confusion of nois=
es like the muffled sounds of a street or factory that filled our ears. I c=
ould make nothing of it, my mind pursued first one rhythm and then another,=
 and questioned it in vain. But after a long time I became aware of a new a=
nd sharper element, not mingling with the rest but standing out, as it were=
, against that cloudy background of sound. It was a series of relatively ve=
ry little definite sounds, tappings and rubbings, like a loose spray of ivy=
 against a window or a bird moving about upon a box. We listened and peered=
 about us, but the darkness was a velvet pall. There followed a noise like =
the subtle movement of the wards of a well-oiled lock. And then there appea=
red before me, hanging as it seemed in an immensity of black, a thin bright=
 line.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook!=E2=80=9D whispered Cavor very softly.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat is it?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t know.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We stared.</p>
			<p>The thin bright line became a band, and broader and paler. It took up=
on itself the quality of a bluish light falling upon a whitewashed wall. It=
 ceased to be parallel-sided; it developed a deep indentation on one side. =
I turned to remark this to Cavor, and was amazed to see his ear in a brilli=
ant illumination=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94all the rest of him in shadow. I twisted =
my head round as well as my bonds would permit. =E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I =
said, =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s behind!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>His ear vanished=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94gave place to an eye!</p>
			<p>Suddenly the crack that had been admitting the light broadened out, a=
nd revealed itself as the space of an opening door. Beyond was a sapphire v=
ista, and in the doorway stood a grotesque outline silhouetted against the =
glare.</p>
			<p>We both made convulsive efforts to turn, and failing, sat staring ove=
r our shoulders at this. My first impression was of some clumsy quadruped w=
ith lowered head. Then I perceived it was the slender pinched body and shor=
t and extremely attenuated bandy legs of a Selenite, with his head depresse=
d between his shoulders. He was without the helmet and body covering they w=
ear upon the exterior.</p>
			<p>He was a blank, black figure to us, but instinctively our imagination=
s supplied features to his very human outline. I, at least, took it instant=
ly that he was somewhat hunchbacked, with a high forehead and long features=
.</p>
			<p>He came forward three steps and paused for a time. His movements seem=
ed absolutely noiseless. Then he came forward again. He walked like a bird,=
 his feet fell one in front of the other. He stepped out of the ray of ligh=
t that came through the doorway, and it seemed as though he vanished altoge=
ther in the shadow.</p>
			<p>For a moment my eyes sought him in the wrong place, and then I percei=
ved him standing facing us both in the full light. Only the human features =
I had attributed to him were not there at all!</p>
			<p>Of course I ought to have expected that, only I didn=E2=80=99t. It ca=
me to me as an absolute, for a moment an overwhelming, shock. It seemed as =
though it wasn=E2=80=99t a face, as though it must needs be a mask, a horro=
r, a deformity, that would presently be disavowed or explained. There was n=
o nose, and the thing had dull bulging eyes at the side=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in=
 the silhouette I had supposed they were ears. There were no ears.=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 I have tried to draw one of these heads, but I =
cannot. There was a mouth, downwardly curved, like a human mouth in a face =
that stares ferociously.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>The neck on which the head was poised was jointed in three places, al=
most like the short joints in the leg of a crab. The joints of the limbs I =
could not see, because of the puttee-like straps in which they were swathed=
, and which formed the only clothing the being wore.</p>
			<p>There the thing was, looking at us!</p>
			<p>At the time my mind was taken up by the mad impossibility of the crea=
ture. I suppose he also was amazed, and with more reason, perhaps, for amaz=
ement than we. Only, confound him! he did not show it. We did at least know=
 what had brought about this meeting of incompatible creatures. But conceiv=
e how it would seem to decent Londoners, for example, to come upon a couple=
 of living things, as big as men and absolutely unlike any other earthly an=
imals, careering about among the sheep in Hyde Park! It must have taken him=
 like that.</p>
			<p>Figure us! We were bound hand and foot, fagged and filthy; our beards=
 two inches long, our faces scratched and bloody. Cavor you must imagine in=
 his knickerbockers (torn in several places by the bayonet scrub), his Jaeg=
er shirt and old cricket cap, his wiry hair wildly disordered, a tail to ev=
ery quarter of the heavens. In that blue light his face did not look red bu=
t very dark, his lips and the drying blood upon my hands seemed black. If p=
ossible I was in a worse plight than he, on account of the yellow fungus in=
to which I had jumped. Our jackets were unbuttoned, and our shoes had been =
taken off and lay at our feet. And we were sitting with our backs to this q=
ueer bluish light, peering at such a monster as D=C3=BCrer might have inven=
ted.</p>
			<p>Cavor broke the silence; started to speak, went hoarse, and cleared h=
is throat. Outside began a terrific bellowing, as if a mooncalf were in tro=
uble. It ended in a shriek, and everything was still again.</p>
			<p>Presently the Selenite turned about, flickered into the shadow, stood=
 for a moment retrospective at the door, and then closed it on us; and once=
 more we were in that murmurous mystery of darkness into which we had awake=
ned.</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9COf course! The moon must be enormously cavernous, with an at=
mosphere within, and at the centre of its caverns a sea.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COne knew that the moon had a lower specific gravity than the=
 earth, one knew that it had little air or water outside, one knew, too, th=
at it was sister planet to the earth, and that it was unaccountable that it=
 should be different in composition. The inference that it was hollowed out=
 was as clear as day. And yet one never saw it as a fact. Kepler, of course=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>His voice had the interest now of a man who has discovered a pretty s=

			<p>=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9CKepler with his <em>sub-volv=

			<p>=E2=80=9CI wish you had taken the trouble to find that out before we =

			<p>He answered nothing, buzzing to himself softly as he pursued his thou=

			<p>=E2=80=9CGood Lord!=E2=80=9D I exclaimed. =E2=80=9CJust think of all =
the trouble we took to get into this pickle! What did we come for? What are=
 we after? What was the moon to us or we to the moon? We wanted too much, w=
e tried too much. We ought to have started the little things first. It was =
you proposed the moon! Those Cavorite spring blinds! I am certain we could =
have worked them for terrestrial purposes. Certain! Did you really understa=
nd what I proposed? A steel cylinder=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CRubbish!=E2=80=9D said Cavor.</p>
			<p>We ceased to converse.</p>
			<p>For a time Cavor kept up a broken monologue without much help from me=
.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf they find it,=E2=80=9D he began, =E2=80=9Cif they find it=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 what will they do with it? Well, that=
=E2=80=99s a question. It may be that=E2=80=99s <em>the</em> question. They=
 won=E2=80=99t understand it, anyhow. If they understood that sort of thing=
 they would have come long since to the earth. Would they? Why shouldn=E2=
=80=99t they? But they would have sent something=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94They coul=
dn=E2=80=99t keep their hands off such a possibility. No! But they will exa=
mine it. Clearly they are intelligent and inquisitive. They will examine it=

!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 That would mean the moon for us for a=

=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAs for strange knowledge=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D said I, =
and language failed me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook here, Bedford,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=80=9Cyou came o=
n this expedition of your own free will.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou said to me, =E2=80=98Call it prospecting.=E2=80=99=E2=80=
=8A=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s always risks in prospecting.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CEspecially when you do it unarmed and without thinking out e=
very possibility.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI was so taken up with the sphere. The thing rushed on us, a=
nd carried us away.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CRushed on <em>me</em>, you mean.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CRushed on me just as much. How was <em>I</em> to know when I=
 set to work on molecular physics that the business would bring me here=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94of all places?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s this accursed science,=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=
=9CIt=E2=80=99s the very Devil. The medieval priests and persecutors were r=
ight and the Moderns are all wrong. You tamper with it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and=
 it offers you gifts. And directly you take them it knocks you to pieces in=
 some unexpected way. Old passions and new weapons=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94now it =
upsets your religion, now it upsets your social ideas, now it whirls you of=
f to desolation and misery!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnyhow, it=E2=80=99s no use your quarrelling with me <em>now=
</em>. These creatures=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94these Selenites, or whatever we cho=
ose to call them=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94have got us tied hand and foot. Whatever =
temper you choose to go through with it in, you will have to go through wit=
h it.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 We have experiences before us tha=
t will need all our coolness.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He paused as if he required my assent. But I sat sulking. =E2=80=9CCo=
nfound your science!=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe problem is communication. Gestures, I fear, will be diff=
erent. Pointing, for example. No creatures but men and monkeys point.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>That was too obviously wrong for me. =E2=80=9CPretty nearly every ani=
mal,=E2=80=9D I cried, =E2=80=9Cpoints with its eyes or nose.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Cavor meditated over that. =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D he said at last, =
=E2=80=9Cand we don=E2=80=99t. There=E2=80=99s such differences=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94such differences!</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COne might.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 But how can I=
 tell? There is speech. The sounds they make, a sort of fluting and piping.=
 I don=E2=80=99t see how we are to imitate that. Is it their speech, that s=
ort of thing? They may have different senses, different means of communicat=
ion. Of course they are minds and we are minds; there must be something in =
common. Who knows how far we may not get to an understanding?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe things are outside us,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CThey=E2=
=80=99re more different from us than the strangest animals on earth. They a=
re a different clay. What is the good of talking like this?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Cavor thought. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t see that. Where there are min=
ds they will have something <em>similar</em>=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94even though t=
hey have been evolved on different planets. Of course if it was a question =
of instincts, if we or they are no more than animals=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, <em>are</em> they? They=E2=80=99re much more like ants=
 on their hind legs than human beings, and who ever got to any sort of unde=
rstanding with ants?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut these machines and clothing! No, I don=E2=80=99t hold wi=
th you, Bedford. The difference is wide=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s insurmountable.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe resemblance must bridge it. I remember reading once a pa=
per by the late Professor Galton on the possibility of communication betwee=
n the planets. Unhappily, at that time it did not seem probable that that w=
ould be of any material benefit to me, and I fear I did not give it the att=
ention I should have done=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in view of this state of affairs=
. Yet.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Now, let me see!</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHis idea was to begin with those broad truths that must unde=
rlie all conceivable mental existences and establish a basis on those. The =
great principles of geometry, to begin with. He proposed to take some leadi=
ng proposition of Euclid=E2=80=99s, and show by construction that its truth=
 was known to us, to demonstrate, for example, that the angles at the base =
of an isosceles triangle are equal, and that if the equal sides be produced=
 the angles on the other side of the base are equal also, or that the squar=
e on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the s=
quares on the two other sides. By demonstrating our knowledge of these thin=
gs we should demonstrate our possession of a reasonable intelligence.=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Now, suppose I=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=A6 I might draw the geometrical figure with a wet finger, or even trace=
 it in the air.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He fell silent. I sat meditating his words. For a time his wild hope =
of communication, of interpretation, with these weird beings held me. Then =
that angry despair that was a part of my exhaustion and physical misery res=
umed its sway. I perceived with a sudden novel vividness the extraordinary =
folly of everything I had ever done. =E2=80=9CAss!=E2=80=9D I said; =E2=80=
=9Coh, ass, unutterable ass.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 I seem to =
exist only to go about doing preposterous things.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=A6 Why did we ever leave the thing?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=A6 Hopping about looking for patents and concessions in the craters of =
the moon!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 If only we had had the sense =
to fasten a handkerchief to a stick to show where we had left the sphere!=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I subsided, fuming.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt is clear,=E2=80=9D meditated Cavor, =E2=80=9Cthey are int=
elligent. One can hypotheticate certain things. As they have not killed us =
at once, they must have ideas of mercy. Mercy! at any rate of restraint. Po=
ssibly of intercourse. They may meet us. And this apartment and the glimpse=
s we had of its guardian. These fetters! A high degree of intelligence.=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI wish to heaven,=E2=80=9D cried I, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d tho=
ught even twice! Plunge after plunge. First one fluky start and then anothe=
r. It was my confidence in you! <em>Why</em> didn=E2=80=99t I stick to my p=
lay? That was what I was equal to. That was my world and the life I was mad=
e for. I could have finished that play. I=E2=80=99m certain=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 it was a good play. I had the scenario as good as don=
e. Then.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Conceive it! leaping to the mo=
on! Practically=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99ve thrown my life away! That old=
 woman in the inn near Canterbury had better sense.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked up, and stopped in mid-sentence. The darkness had given plac=
e to that bluish light again. The door was opening, and several noiseless S=
elenites were coming into the chamber. I became quite still, staring at the=
ir grotesque faces.</p>
			<p>Then suddenly my sense of disagreeable strangeness changed to interes=
t. I perceived that the foremost and second carried bowls. One elemental ne=
ed at least our minds could understand in common. They were bowls of some m=
etal that, like our fetters, looked dark in that bluish light; and each con=
tained a number of whitish fragments. All the cloudy pain and misery that o=
ppressed me rushed together and took the shape of hunger. I eyed these bowl=
s wolfishly, and, though it returned to me in dreams, at that time it seeme=
d a small matter that at the end of the arms that lowered one towards me we=
re not hands, but a sort of flap and thumb, like the end of an elephant=E2=
=80=99s trunk.</p>
			<p>The stuff in the bowl was loose in texture, and whitish brown in colo=
ur=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94rather like lumps of some cold souffl=C3=A9, and it sme=
lt faintly like mushrooms. From a partially divided carcass of a mooncalf t=
hat we presently saw, I am inclined to believe it must have been mooncalf f=
lesh.</p>
			<p>My hands were so tightly chained that I could barely contrive to reac=
h the bowl; but when they saw the effort I made, two of them dexterously re=
leased one of the turns about my wrist. Their tentacle hands were soft and =
cold to my skin. I immediately seized a mouthful of the food. It had the sa=
me laxness in texture that all organic structures seem to have upon the moo=
n; it tasted rather like a gauffre or a damp meringue, but in no way was it=
 disagreeable. I took two other mouthfuls. =E2=80=9CI <em>wanted</em>=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94foo=E2=80=99!=E2=80=9D said I, tearing off a still larger piece=
.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>For a time we ate with an utter absence of self-consciousness. We ate=
 and presently drank like tramps in a soup kitchen. Never before nor since =
have I been hungry to the ravenous pitch, and save that I have had this ver=
y experience I could never have believed that, a quarter of a million of mi=
les out of our proper world, in utter perplexity of soul, surrounded, watch=
ed, touched by beings more grotesque and inhuman than the worst creations o=
f a nightmare, it would be possible for me to eat in utter forgetfulness of=
 all these things. They stood about us watching us, and ever and again maki=
ng a slight elusive twittering that stood them, I suppose, in the stead of =
speech. I did not even shiver at their touch. And when the first zeal of my=
 feeding was over, I could note that Cavor, too, had been eating with the s=
ame shameless abandon.</p>

			<p>When at last we had made an end of eating, the Selenites linked our h=
ands closely together again, and then untwisted the chains about our feet a=
nd rebound them, so as to give us a limited freedom of movement. Then they =
unfastened the chains about our waists. To do all this they had to handle u=
s freely, and ever and again one of their queer heads came down close to my=
 face, or a soft tentacle-hand touched my head or neck. I don=E2=80=99t rem=
ember that I was afraid then or repelled by their proximity. I think that o=
ur incurable anthropomorphism made us imagine there were human heads inside=
 their masks. The skin, like everything else, looked bluish, but that was o=
n account of the light; and it was hard and shiny, quite in the beetle-wing=
 fashion, not soft, or moist, or hairy, as a vertebrated animal=E2=80=99s w=
ould be. Along the crest of the head was a low ridge of whitish spines runn=
ing from back to front, and a much larger ridge curved on either side over =
the eyes. The Selenite who untied me used his mouth to help his hands.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey seem to be releasing us,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=80=9C=
Remember we are on the moon! Make no sudden movements!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAre you going to try that geometry?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf I get a chance. But, of course, they may make an advance =
first.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We remained passive, and the Selenites, having finished their arrange=
ments, stood back from us, and seemed to be looking at us. I say seemed to =
be, because as their eyes were at the side and not in front, one had the sa=
me difficulty in determining the direction in which they were looking as on=
e has in the case of a hen or a fish. They conversed with one another in th=
eir reedy tones, that seemed to me impossible to imitate or define. The doo=
r behind us opened wider, and, glancing over my shoulder, I saw a vague lar=
ge space beyond, in which quite a little crowd of Selenites were standing. =
They seemed a curiously miscellaneous rabble.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CDo they want us to imitate those sounds?=E2=80=9D I asked Ca=
vor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think so,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt seems to me that they are trying to make us understand so=
mething.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t make anything of their gestures. Do you noti=
ce this one, who is worrying with his head like a man with an uncomfortable=
 collar?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLet us shake our heads at him.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We did that, and finding it ineffectual, attempted an imitation of th=
e Selenites=E2=80=99 movements. That seemed to interest them. At any rate t=
hey all set up the same movement. But as that seemed to lead to nothing, we=
 desisted at last and so did they, and fell into a piping argument among th=
emselves. Then one of them, shorter and very much thicker than the others, =
and with a particularly wide mouth, squatted down suddenly beside Cavor, an=
d put his hands and feet in the same posture as Cavor=E2=80=99s were bound,=
 and then by a dexterous movement stood up.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I shouted, =E2=80=9Cthey want us to get up!=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He stared open-mouthed. =E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s it!=E2=80=9D he said.=
</p>
			<p>And with much heaving and grunting, because our hands were tied toget=
her, we contrived to struggle to our feet. The Selenites made way for our e=
lephantine heavings, and seemed to twitter more volubly. As soon as we were=
 on our feet the thickset Selenite came and patted each of our faces with h=
is tentacles, and walked towards the open doorway. That also was plain enou=
gh, and we followed him. We saw that four of the Selenites standing in the =
doorway were much taller than the others, and clothed in the same manner as=
 those we had seen in the crater, namely, with spiked round helmets and cyl=
indrical body-cases, and that each of the four carried a goad with spike an=
d guard made of that same dull-looking metal as the bowls. These four close=
d about us, one on either side of each of us, as we emerged from our chambe=
r into the cavern from which the light had come.</p>
			<p>We did not get our impression of that cavern all at once. Our attenti=
on was taken up by the movements and attitudes of the Selenites immediately=
 about us, and by the necessity of controlling our motion, lest we should s=
tartle and alarm them and ourselves by some excessive stride. In front of u=
s was the short, thickset being who had solved the problem of asking us to =
get up, moving with gestures that seemed, almost all of them, intelligible =
to us, inviting us to follow him. His spout-like face turned from one of us=
 to the other with a quickness that was clearly interrogative. For a time, =
I say, we were taken up with these things.</p>
			<p>But at last the great place that formed a background to our movements=
 asserted itself. It became apparent that the source of much, at least, of =
the tumult of sounds which had filled our ears ever since we had recovered =
from the stupefaction of the fungus was a vast mass of machinery in active =
movement, whose flying and whirling parts were visible indistinctly over th=
e heads and between the bodies of the Selenites who walked about us. And no=
t only did the web of sounds that filled the air proceed from this mechanis=
m, but also the peculiar blue light that irradiated the whole place. We had=
 taken it as a natural thing that a subterranean cavern should be artificia=
lly lit, and even now, though the fact was patent to my eyes, I did not rea=
lly grasp its import until presently the darkness came. The meaning and str=
ucture of this huge apparatus we saw I cannot explain, because we neither o=
f us learnt what it was for or how it worked. One after another, big shafts=
 of metal flung out and up from its centre, their heads travelling in what =
seemed to me to be a parabolic path; each dropped a sort of dangling arm as=
 it rose towards the apex of its flight and plunged down into a vertical cy=
linder, forcing this down before it. About it moved the shapes of tenders, =
little figures that seemed vaguely different from the beings about us. As e=
ach of the three dangling arms of the machine plunged down, there was a cla=
nk and then a roaring, and out of the top of the vertical cylinder came pou=
ring this incandescent substance that lit the place, and ran over as milk r=
uns over a boiling pot, and dripped luminously into a tank of light below. =
It was a cold blue light, a sort of phosphorescent glow but infinitely brig=
hter, and from the tanks into which it fell it ran in conduits athwart the =
cavern.</p>
			<p>Thud, thud, thud, thud, came the sweeping arms of this unintelligible=
 apparatus, and the light substance hissed and poured. At first the thing s=
eemed only reasonably large and near to us, and then I saw how exceedingly =
little the Selenites upon it seemed, and I realised the full immensity of c=
avern and machine. I looked from this tremendous affair to the faces of the=
 Selenites with a new respect. I stopped, and Cavor stopped, and stared at =
this thunderous engine.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut this is stupendous!=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CWhat can i=
t be for?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Cavor=E2=80=99s blue-lit face was full of an intelligent respect. =E2=
=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t dream! Surely these beings=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94Men could=
 not make a thing like that! Look at those arms, are they on connecting rod=
s?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>The thickset Selenite had gone some paces unheeded. He came back and =
stood between us and the great machine. I avoided seeing him, because I gue=
ssed somehow that his idea was to beckon us onward. He walked away in the d=
irection he wished us to go, and turned and came back, and flicked our face=
s to attract our attention.</p>
			<p>Cavor and I looked at one another.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCannot we show him we are interested in the machine?=E2=80=
=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said Cavor. =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll try that.=
=E2=80=9D He turned to our guide and smiled, and pointed to the machine, an=
d pointed again, and then to his head, and then to the machine. By some def=
ect of reasoning he seemed to imagine that broken English might help these =
gestures. =E2=80=9CMe look =E2=80=99im,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cme think=

			<p>His behaviour seemed to check the Selenites in their desire for our p=
rogress for a moment. They faced one another, their queer heads moved, the =
twittering voices came quick and liquid. Then one of them, a lean, tall cre=
ature, with a sort of mantle added to the puttee in which the others were d=
ressed, twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about Cavor=E2=80=99s waist, a=
nd pulled him gently to follow our guide, who again went on ahead.</p>
			<p>Cavor resisted. =E2=80=9CWe may just as well begin explaining ourselv=
es now. They may think we are new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps! =
It is most important that we should show an intelligent interest from the o=
utset.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He began to shake his head violently. =E2=80=9CNo, no,=E2=80=9D he sa=
id, =E2=80=9Cme not come on one minute. Me look at =E2=80=99im.=E2=80=9D
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CIsn=E2=80=99t there some geometrical point you might bring i=
n apropos of that affair?=E2=80=9D I suggested, as the Selenites conferred =
again.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPossibly a parabolic=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D he began.
			</p><p>He yelled loudly, and leaped six feet or more!</p>
			<p>One of the four armed moon-men had pricked him with a goad!</p>
			<p>I turned on the goad-bearer behind me with a swift threatening gestur=
e, and he started back. This and Cavor=E2=80=99s sudden shout and leap clea=
rly astonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily, facing us. For one =
of those moments that seem to last forever, we stood in angry protest, with=
 a scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about us.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe pricked me!=E2=80=9D said Cavor, with a catching of the v=
oice.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI saw him,=E2=80=9D I answered.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConfound it!=E2=80=9D I said to the Selenites; =E2=80=9Cwe=
=E2=80=99re not going to stand that! What on earth do you take us for?=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>I glanced quickly right and left. Far away across the blue wilderness=
 of cavern I saw a number of other Selenites running towards us; broad and =
slender they were, and one with a larger head than the others. The cavern s=
pread wide and low, and receded in every direction into darkness. Its roof,=
 I remember, seemed to bulge down as if with the weight of the vast thickne=
ss of rocks that prisoned us. There was no way out of it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94n=
o way out of it. Above, below, in every direction, was the unknown, and the=
se inhuman creatures, with goads and gestures, confronting us, and we two u=
nsupported men!</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>Just for a moment that hostile pause endured. I suppose that both we =
and the Selenites did some very rapid thinking. My clearest impression was =
that there was nothing to put my back against, and that we were bound to be=
 surrounded and killed. The overwhelming folly of our presence there loomed=
 over me in black, enormous reproach. Why had I ever launched myself on thi=
s mad, inhuman expedition?</p>
			<p>Cavor came to my side and laid his hand on my arm. His pale and terri=
fied face was ghastly in the blue light.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe can=E2=80=99t do anything,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CIt=
=E2=80=99s a mistake. They don=E2=80=99t understand. We must go. As they wa=
nt us to go.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked down at him, and then at the fresh Selenites who were coming=
 to help their fellows. =E2=80=9CIf I had my hands free=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s no use,=E2=80=9D he panted.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll go.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>And he turned about and led the way in the direction that had been in=
dicated for us.</p>
			<p>I followed, trying to look as subdued as possible, and feeling at the=
 chains about my wrists. My blood was boiling. I noted nothing more of that=
 cavern, though it seemed to take a long time before we had marched across =
it, or if I noted anything I forgot it as I saw it. My thoughts were concen=
trated, I think, upon my chains and the Selenites, and particularly upon th=
e helmeted ones with the goads. At first they marched parallel with us, and=
 at a respectful distance, but presently they were overtaken by three other=
s, and then they drew nearer, until they were within arm=E2=80=99s length a=
gain. I winced like a beaten horse as they came near to us. The shorter, th=
icker Selenite marched at first on our right flank, but presently came in f=
ront of us again.</p>
			<p>How well the picture of that grouping has bitten into my brain; the b=
ack of Cavor=E2=80=99s downcast head just in front of me, and the dejected =
droop of his shoulders, and our guide=E2=80=99s gaping visage, perpetually =
jerking about him, and the goad-bearers on either side, watchful, yet open-=
mouthed=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a blue monochrome. And, after all, I <em>do</em> r=
emember one other thing besides the purely personal affair, which is, that =
a sort of gutter came presently across the floor of the cavern, and then ra=
n along by the side of the path of rock we followed. And it was full of tha=
t same bright blue luminous stuff that flowed out of the great machine. I w=
alked close beside it, and I can testify it radiated not a particle of heat=
. It was brightly shining, and yet it was neither warmer nor colder than an=
ything else in the cavern.</p>
			<p>Clang, clang, clang, we passed right under the thumping levers of ano=
ther vast machine, and so came at last to a wide tunnel, in which we could =
even hear the pad, pad of our shoeless feet, and which, save for the trickl=
ing thread of blue to the right of us, was quite unlit. The shadows made gi=
gantic travesties of our shapes and those of the Selenites on the irregular=
 wall and roof of the tunnel. Ever and again crystals in the walls of the t=
unnel scintillated like gems, ever and again the tunnel expanded into a sta=
lactitic cavern, or gave off branches that vanished into darkness.</p>
			<p>We seemed to be marching down that tunnel for a long time. <i>Trickle=
, trickle</i>, went the flowing light very softly, and our footfalls and th=
eir echoes made an irregular paddle, paddle. My mind settled down to the qu=
estion of my chains. If I were to slip off one turn <em>so</em>, and then t=
o twist it <em>so</em>.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>If I tried to do it very gradually, would they see I was slipping my =
wrist out of the looser turn? If they did, what would they do?</p>

			<p>His remark roused me from my sullen preoccupation.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf they wanted to kill us,=E2=80=9D he said, dropping back t=

			</p><p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve got to endure it,=E2=80=9D said I.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThere may be others less stupid. This is the mere outer frin=
ge of their world. It must go down and down, cavern, passage, tunnel, down =
at last to the sea=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94hundreds of miles below.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>His words made me think of the mile or so of rock and tunnel that mig=
ht be over our heads already. It was like a weight dropping on my shoulders=
. =E2=80=9CAway from the sun and air,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CEven a mine=
 half a mile deep is stuffy.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThis is not, anyhow. It=E2=80=99s probable=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=
Ventilation! The air would blow from the dark side of the moon to the sunli=
t, and all the carbonic acid would well out there and feed those plants. Up=
 this tunnel, for example, there is quite a breeze. And what a world it mus=
t be. The earnest we have in that shaft, and those machines=E2=81=A0=E2=80=

			<p>=E2=80=9CEven that goad=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI was angry at the time. But=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94It was perhaps=
 necessary we should get on. They have different skins, and probably differ=
ent nerves. They may not understand our objection=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94Just as =

			<p>=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99d better be careful how they nudge <em>me</em>.=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd about that geometry. After all, their way is a way of un=
derstanding, too. They begin with the elements of life and not of thought. =
Food. Compulsion. Pain. They strike at fundamentals.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s no doubt about <em>that</em>,=E2=80=9D I sai=
d.</p>
			<p>He went on to talk of the enormous and wonderful world into which we =
were being taken. I realised slowly from his tone, that even now he was not=
 absolutely in despair at the prospect of going ever deeper into this inhum=
an planet-burrow. His mind ran on machines and invention, to the exclusion =
of a thousand dark things that beset me. It wasn=E2=80=99t that he intended=
 to make any use of these things, he simply wanted to know them.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAfter all,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthis is a tremendous o=
ccasion. It is the meeting of two worlds! What are we going to see? Think o=

 this scale=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94There will be everything. Do you notice how di=
fferent they seem one from another? The story we shall take back!=E2=80=9D&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CSome rare sort of animal,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cmight co=

=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 It doesn=E2=80=99t follow that we are going to =
be shown all these things.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhen they find we have reasonable minds,=E2=80=9D said Cavor=
, =E2=80=9Cthey will want to learn about the earth. Even if they have no ge=
nerous emotions, they will teach in order to learn.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=A6 And the things they must know! The unanticipated things!=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>He went on to speculate on the possibility of their knowing things he=
 had never hoped to learn on earth, speculating in that way, with a raw wou=
nd from that goad already in his skin! Much that he said I forget, for my a=
ttention was drawn to the fact that the tunnel along which we had been marc=
hing was opening out wider and wider. We seemed, from the feeling of the ai=
r, to be going out into a huge space. But how big the space might really be=
 we could not tell, because it was unlit. Our little stream of light ran in=
 a dwindling thread and vanished far ahead. Presently the rocky walls had v=
anished altogether on either hand. There was nothing to be seen but the pat=
h in front of us and the trickling, hurrying rivulet of blue phosphorescenc=
e. The figures of Cavor and the guiding Selenite marched before me, the sid=
es of their legs and heads that were towards the rivulet were clear and bri=
ght blue, their darkened sides, now that the reflection of the tunnel wall =
no longer lit them, merged indistinguishably in the darkness beyond.</p>
			<p>And soon I perceived that we were approaching a declivity of some sor=
t, because the little blue stream dipped suddenly out of sight.</p>
			<p>In another moment, as it seemed, we had reached the edge. The shining=
 stream gave one meander of hesitation and then rushed over. It fell to a d=
epth at which the sound of its descent was absolutely lost to us. Far below=
 was a bluish glow, a sort of blue mist=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94at an infinite dis=
tance below. And the darkness the stream dropped out of became utterly void=
 and black, save that a thing like a plank projected from the edge of the c=
liff and stretched out and faded and vanished altogether. There was a warm =
air blowing up out of the gulf.</p>
			<p>For a moment I and Cavor stood as near the edge as we dared, peering =
into a blue-tinged profundity. And then our guide was pulling at my arm.
			</p><p>Then he left me, and walked to the end of that plank and stepped upon=
 it, looking back. Then when he perceived we watched him, he turned about a=
nd went on along it, walking as surely as though he was on firm earth. For =
a moment his form was distinct, then he became a blue blur, and then vanish=
ed into the obscurity. I became aware of some vague shape looming darkly ou=
t of the black.</p>
			<p>There was a pause. =E2=80=9CSurely=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94!=E2=80=9D said C=
avor.</p>
			<p>One of the other Selenites walked a few paces out upon the plank, and=
 turned and looked back at us unconcernedly. The others stood ready to foll=
ow after us. Our guide=E2=80=99s expectant figure reappeared. He was return=
ing to see why we had not advanced.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat is that beyond there?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t see.=E2=80=9D</p>

			</p><p>=E2=80=9CI could not go three steps on it,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=
=80=9Ceven with my hands free.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We looked at each other=E2=80=99s drawn faces in blank consternation.=

			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s quite impossible for us to walk that plank.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t believe they see as we do. I=E2=80=99ve been=
 watching them. I wonder if they know this is simply blackness for us. How =
can we make them understand?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnyhow, we must make them understand.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I think we said these things with a vague half hope the Selenites mig=
ht somehow understand. I knew quite clearly that all that was needed was an=
 explanation. Then as I saw their faces, I realised that an explanation was=
 impossible. Just here it was that our resemblances were not going to bridg=
e our differences. Well, I wasn=E2=80=99t going to walk the plank, anyhow. =
I slipped my wrist very quickly out of the coil of chain that was loose, an=
d then began to twist my wrists in opposite directions. I was standing near=
est to the bridge, and as I did this two of the Selenites laid hold of me, =
and pulled me gently towards it.</p>
			<p>I shook my head violently. =E2=80=9CNo go,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9C=
no use. You don=E2=80=99t understand.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Another Selenite added his compulsion. I was forced to step forward.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve got an idea,=E2=80=9D said Cavor; but I knew hi=
s ideas.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook here!=E2=80=9D I exclaimed to the Selenites. =E2=80=9CS=
teady on! It=E2=80=99s all very well for you=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I sprang round upon my heel. I burst out into curses. For one of the =
armed Selenites had stabbed me behind with his goad.</p>
			<p>I wrenched my wrists free from the little tentacles that held them. I=
 turned on the goad-bearer. =E2=80=9CConfound you!=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=
=9CI=E2=80=99ve warned you of that. What on earth do you think I=E2=80=99m =
made of, to stick that into me? If you touch me again=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94!=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>By way of answer he pricked me forthwith.</p>
			<p>I heard Cavor=E2=80=99s voice in alarm and entreaty. Even then I thin=
k he wanted to compromise with these creatures. =E2=80=9CI say, Bedford,=E2=
=80=9D he cried, =E2=80=9CI know a way!=E2=80=9D But the sting of that seco=
nd stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Inst=
antly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all consider=
ations that had held us unresisting in the hands of these moon creatures. F=
or that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought =
of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad.=
 The chain was twisted round my fist.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6<!--
p-->
			</p><p>There came another of these beastly surprises of which the moon world=
 is full.</p>
			<p>My mailed hand seemed to go clean through him. He smashed like=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94like some softish sort of sweet with liquid in it! He broke rig=
ht in! He squelched and splashed. It was like hitting a damp toadstool. The=
 flimsy body went spinning a dozen yards, and fell with a flabby impact. I =
was astonished. I was incredulous that any living thing could be so flimsy.=
 For an instant I could have believed the whole thing a dream.</p>
			<p>Then it had become real and imminent again. Neither Cavor nor the oth=
er Selenites seemed to have done anything from the time when I had turned a=
bout to the time when the dead Selenite hit the ground. Every one stood bac=
k from us two, every one alert. That arrest seemed to last at least a secon=
d after the Selenite was down. Everyone must have been taking the thing in.=
 I seem to remember myself standing with my arm half retracted, trying also=
 to take it in. =E2=80=9CWhat next?=E2=80=9D clamoured my brain; =E2=80=9Cw=
hat next?=E2=80=9D Then in a moment every one was moving!</p>
			<p>I perceived we must get our chains loose, and that before we could do=
 this these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of th=
e three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad at me. It swished over m=
y head, and I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.</p>
			<p>I leaped right at him with all my might as the goad flew over me. He =
turned to run as I jumped, and I bore him to the ground, came down right up=
on him, and slipped upon his smashed body and fell. He seemed to wriggle un=
der my foot.</p>
			<p>I came into a sitting position, and on every hand the blue backs of t=
he Selenites were receding into the darkness. I bent a link by main force a=
nd untwisted the chain that had hampered me about the ankles, and sprang to=
 my feet, with the chain in my hand. Another goad, flung javelin-wise, whis=
tled by me, and I made a rush towards the darkness out of which it had come=
. Then I turned back towards Cavor, who was still standing in the light of =
the rivulet near the gulf convulsively busy with his wrists, and at the sam=
e time jabbering nonsense about his idea.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCome on!=E2=80=9D I cried.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy hands!=E2=80=9D he answered.</p>
			<p>Then, realising that I dared not run back to him, because my ill-calc=
ulated steps might carry me over the edge, he came shuffling towards me, wi=
th his hands held out before him.</p>
			<p>I gripped his chains at once to unfasten them.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhere are they?=E2=80=9D he panted.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CRun away. They=E2=80=99ll come back. They=E2=80=99re throwin=
g things! Which way shall we go?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBy the light. To that tunnel. Eh?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said I, and his hands were free.</p>
			<p>I dropped on my knees and fell to work on his ankle bonds. Whack came=
 something=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I know not what=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and splashed t=
he livid streamlet into drops about us. Far away on our right a piping and =
whistling began.</p>
			<p>I whipped the chain off his feet, and put it in his hand. =E2=80=9CHi=
t with that!=E2=80=9D I said, and without waiting for an answer, set off in=
 big bounds along the path by which we had come. I had a nasty sort of feel=
ing that these things could jump out of the darkness on to my back. I heard=
 the impact of his leaps come following after me.</p>
			<p>We ran in vast strides. But that running, you must understand, was an=
 altogether different thing from any running on earth. On earth one leaps a=
nd almost instantly hits the ground again, but on the moon, because of its =
weaker pull, one shot through the air for several seconds before one came t=
o earth. In spite of our violent hurry this gave an effect of long pauses, =
pauses in which one might have counted seven or eight. =E2=80=9CStep,=E2=80=
=9D and one soared off! All sorts of questions ran through my mind: =E2=80=
=9CWhere are the Selenites? What will they do? Shall we ever get to that tu=
nnel? Is Cavor far behind? Are they likely to cut him off?=E2=80=9D Then wh=
ack, stride, and off again for another step.</p>
			<p>I saw a Selenite running in front of me, his legs going exactly as a =
man=E2=80=99s would go on earth, saw him glance over his shoulder, and hear=
d him shriek as he ran aside out of my way into the darkness. He was, I thi=
nk, our guide, but I am not sure. Then in another vast stride the walls of =
rock had come into view on either hand, and in two more strides I was in th=
e tunnel, and tempering my pace to its low roof. I went on to a bend, then =
stopped and turned back, and plug, plug, plug, Cavor came into view, splash=
ing into the stream of blue light at every stride, and grew larger and blun=
dered into me. We stood clutching each other. For a moment, at least, we ha=
d shaken off our captors and were alone.</p>
			<p>We were both very much out of breath. We spoke in panting, broken sen=
tences.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99ve spoilt it all!=E2=80=9D panted Cavor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNonsense,=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=9CIt was that or death!=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat are we to do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHide.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow can we?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s dark enough.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut where?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CUp one of these side caverns.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd then?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThink.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CRight=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94come on.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We strode on, and presently came to a radiating dark cavern. Cavor wa=
s in front. He hesitated, and chose a black mouth that seemed to promise go=
od hiding. He went towards it and turned.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s dark,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYour legs and feet will light us. You=E2=80=99re wet with th=
at luminous stuff.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>A tumult of sounds, and in particular a sound like a clanging gong, a=
dvancing up the main tunnel, became audible. It was horribly suggestive of =
a tumultuous pursuit. We made a bolt for the unlit side cavern forthwith. A=
s we ran along it our way was lit by the irradiation of Cavor=E2=80=99s leg=
s. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s lucky,=E2=80=9D I panted, =E2=80=9Cthey took off o=
ur boots, or we should fill this place with clatter.=E2=80=9D On we rushed,=
 taking as small steps as we could to avoid striking the roof of the cavern=
. After a time we seemed to be gaining on the uproar. It became muffled, it=
 dwindled, it died away.</p>
			<p>I stopped and looked back, and I heard the pad, pad of Cavor=E2=80=99=
s feet receding. Then he stopped also. =E2=80=9CBedford,=E2=80=9D he whispe=
red; =E2=80=9Cthere=E2=80=99s a sort of light in front of us.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked, and at first could see nothing. Then I perceived his head a=
nd shoulders dimly outlined against a fainter darkness. I saw, also, that t=
his mitigation of the darkness was not blue, as all the other light within =
the moon had been, but a pallid grey, a very vague, faint white, the daylig=
ht colour. Cavor noted this difference as soon or sooner than I did, and I =
think, too, that it filled him with much the same wild hope.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBedford,=E2=80=9D he whispered, and his voice trembled. =E2=
=80=9CThat light=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it is possible=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D=
</p>
			<p>He did not dare to say the thing he hoped. Then came a pause. Suddenl=
y I knew by the sound of his feet that he was striding towards that pallor.=
 I followed him with a beating heart.</p>

			<p>The light grew stronger as we advanced. In a little time it was nearl=
y as strong as the phosphorescence on Cavor=E2=80=99s legs. Our tunnel was =
expanding into a cavern, and this new light was at the farther end of it. I=
 perceived something that set my hopes leaping and bounding.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cit comes from above! I am c=
ertain it comes from above!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He made no answer, but hurried on.</p>
			<p>Indisputably it was a grey light; a silvery light.</p>
			<p>In another moment we were beneath it. It filtered down through a chin=
k in the walls of the cavern, and as I stared up, drip, came a drop of wate=
r upon my face. I started and stood aside=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94drip, fell anoth=
er drop quite audibly on the rocky floor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cif one of us lifts the othe=
r, he can reach that crack!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll lift you,=E2=80=9D he said, and incontinently h=
oisted me as though I was a baby.</p>
			<p>I thrust an arm into the crack, and just at my finger tips found a li=
ttle ledge by which I could hold. I could see the white light was very much=
 brighter now. I pulled myself up by two fingers with scarcely an effort, t=
hough on earth I weigh twelve stone, reached to a still higher corner of ro=
ck, and so got my feet on the narrow ledge. I stood up and searched up the =
rocks with my fingers; the cleft broadened out upwardly. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=
=99s climbable,=E2=80=9D I said to Cavor. =E2=80=9CCan you jump up to my ha=
nd if I hold it down to you?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I wedged myself between the sides of the cleft, rested knee and foot =
on the ledge, and extended a hand. I could not see Cavor, but I could hear =
the rustle of his movements as he crouched to spring. Then whack and he was=
 hanging to my arm=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and no heavier than a kitten! I lugged =
him up until he had a hand on my ledge, and could release me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConfound it!=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Canyone could be a mou=
ntaineer on the moon;=E2=80=9D and so set myself in earnest to the climbing=
. For a few minutes I clambered steadily, and then I looked up again. The c=
left opened out steadily, and the light was brighter. Only=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94</p>
			<p>It was not daylight after all!</p>
			<p>In another moment I could see what it was, and at the sight I could h=
ave beaten my head against the rocks with disappointment. For I beheld simp=
ly an irregularly sloping open space, and all over its slanting floor stood=
 a forest of little club-shaped fungi, each shining gloriously with that pi=
nkish silvery light. For a moment I stared at their soft radiance, then spr=
ang forward and upward among them. I plucked up half-a-dozen and flung them=
 against the rocks, and then sat down, laughing bitterly, as Cavor=E2=80=99=
s ruddy face came into view.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s phosphorescence again!=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=
=9CNo need to hurry. Sit down and make yourself at home.=E2=80=9D And as he=
 spluttered over our disappointment, I began to lob more of these growths i=
nto the cleft.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI thought it was daylight,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CDaylight!=E2=80=9D cried I. =E2=80=9CDaybreak, sunset, cloud=
s, and windy skies! Shall we ever see such things again?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>As I spoke, a little picture of our world seemed to rise before me, b=
right and little and clear, like the background of some old Italian picture=
. =E2=80=9CThe sky that changes, and the sea that changes, and the hills an=
d the green trees and the towns and cities shining in the sun. Think of a w=
et roof at sunset, Cavor! Think of the windows of a westward house!=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>He made no answer.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHere we are burrowing in this beastly world that isn=E2=80=
=99t a world, with its inky ocean hidden in some abominable blackness below=
, and outside that torrid day and that death stillness of night. And all th=
ose things that are chasing us now, beastly men of leather=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94insect men, that come out of a nightmare! After all, they=E2=80=99re rig=
ht! What business have we here smashing them and disturbing their world? Fo=
r all we know the whole planet is up and after us already. In a minute we m=
ay hear them whimpering, and their gongs going. What are we to do? Where ar=
e we to go? Here we are as comfortable as snakes from Jamrach=E2=80=99s loo=
se in a Surbiton villa!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt was your fault,=E2=80=9D said Cavor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy fault!=E2=80=9D I shouted. =E2=80=9CGood Lord!=E2=80=9D<!--

			</p><p>=E2=80=9CI had an idea!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCurse your ideas!=E2=80=9D</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CUnder these goads?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes. They would have carried us!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COver that bridge?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes. They must have carried us from outside.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99d rather be carried by a fly across a ceiling.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGood Heavens!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I resumed my destruction of the fungi. Then suddenly I saw something =
that struck me even then.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cthese chains are of gold!=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He was thinking intently, with his hands gripping his cheeks. He turn=
ed his head slowly and stared at me, and when I had repeated my words, at t=
he twisted chain about his right hand. =E2=80=9CSo they are,=E2=80=9D he sa=
id, =E2=80=9Cso they are.=E2=80=9D His face lost its transitory interest ev=
en as he looked. He hesitated for a moment, then went on with his interrupt=
ed meditation. I sat for a space puzzling over the fact that I had only jus=
t observed this, until I considered the blue light in which we had been, an=
d which had taken all the colour out of the metal. And from that discovery =
I also started upon a train of thought that carried me wide and far. I forg=
ot that I had just been asking what business we had in the moon. Gold=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94</p>
			<p>It was Cavor who spoke first. =E2=80=9CIt seems to me that there are =
two courses open to us.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CEither we can attempt to make our way=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94fight=
 our way if necessary=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94out to the exterior again, and then =
hunt for our sphere until we find it, or the cold of the night comes to kil=
l us, or else=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He paused. =E2=80=9CYes?=E2=80=9D I said, though I knew what was comi=
ng.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe might attempt once more to establish some sort of underst=
anding with the minds of the people in the moon.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSo far as I=E2=80=99m concerned=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99=

			<p>=E2=80=9CI doubt.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou see,=E2=80=9D said Cavor, =E2=80=9CI do not think we can=
 judge the Selenites by what we have seen of them. Their central world, the=
ir civilised world will be far below in the profounder caverns about their =
sea. This region of the crust in which we are is an outlying district, a pa=
storal region. At any rate, that is my interpretation. These Selenites we h=
ave seen may be only the equivalent of cowboys and engine tenders. Their us=
e of goads=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in all probability mooncalf goads=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94the lack of imagination they show in expecting us to be able to do ju=
st what they can do, their indisputable brutality, all seem to point to som=
ething of that sort. But if we endured=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNeither of us could endure a six-inch plank across the botto=
mless pit for very long.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D said Cavor; =E2=80=9Cbut then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI <em>won=E2=80=99t</em>,=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>He discovered a new line of possibilities. =E2=80=9CWell, suppose we =
got ourselves into some corner, where we could defend ourselves against the=
se hinds and labourers. If, for example, we could hold out for a week or so=
, it is probable that the news of our appearance would filter down to the m=
ore intelligent and populous parts=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf they exist.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey must exist, or whence came those tremendous machines?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s possible, but it=E2=80=99s the worst of the t=
wo chances.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe might write up inscriptions on walls=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow do we know their eyes would see the sort of marks we mad=
e?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf we cut them=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s possible, of course.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I took up a new thread of thought. =E2=80=9CAfter all,=E2=80=9D I sai=
d, =E2=80=9CI suppose you don=E2=80=99t think these Selenites so infinitely=
 wiser than men.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey must know a lot more=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94or at least a lot=
 of different things.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes, but=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D I hesitated.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI think you=E2=80=99ll quite admit, Cavor, that you=E2=80=99=
re rather an exceptional man.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, you=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94you=E2=80=99re a rather lonely ma=
n=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94have been, that is. You haven=E2=80=99t married.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNever wanted to. But why=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd you never grew richer than you happened to be?=E2=80=9D&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CNever wanted that either.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99ve just rooted after knowledge?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, a certain curiosity is natural=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou think so. That=E2=80=99s just it. You think every other =
mind wants to <em>know</em>. I remember once, when I asked you why you cond=
ucted all these researches, you said you wanted your <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z39=" 98:initialism"="">F.R.S.</abbr>, and to have the stuff called Cavorite, and th=
ings like that. You know perfectly well you didn=E2=80=99t do it for that; =
but at the time my question took you by surprise, and you felt you ought to=
 have something to look like a motive. Really you conducted researches beca=
use you <em>had</em> to. It=E2=80=99s your twist.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPerhaps it is=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt isn=E2=80=99t one man in a million has that twist. Most m=
en want=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94well, various things, but very few want knowledge =
for its own sake. <em>I</em> don=E2=80=99t, I know perfectly well. Now, the=
se Selenites seem to be a driving, busy sort of being, but how do you know =
that even the most intelligent will take an interest in us or our world? I =
don=E2=80=99t believe they=E2=80=99ll even know we have a world. They never=
 come out at night=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94they=E2=80=99d freeze if they did. They=
=E2=80=99ve probably never seen any heavenly body at all except the blazing=
 sun. How are they to know there <em>is</em> another world? What does it ma=
tter to them if they do? Well, even if they <em>have</em> had a glimpse of =
a few stars, or even of the earth crescent, what of that? Why should people=
 living <em>inside</em> a planet trouble to observe that sort of thing? Men=
 wouldn=E2=80=99t have done it except for the seasons and sailing; why shou=
ld the moon people?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, suppose there are a few philosophers like yourself. Th=
ey are just the very Selenites who=E2=80=99ll never hear of our existence. =
Suppose a Selenite had dropped on the earth when you were at Lympne, you=E2=
=80=99d have been the last man in the world to hear he had come. You never =
read a newspaper! You see the chances against you. Well, it=E2=80=99s for t=
hese chances we=E2=80=99re sitting here doing nothing while precious time i=
s flying. I tell you we=E2=80=99ve got into a fix. We=E2=80=99ve come unarm=
ed, we=E2=80=99ve lost our sphere, we=E2=80=99ve got no food, we=E2=80=99ve=
 shown ourselves to the Selenites, and made them think we=E2=80=99re strang=
e, strong, dangerous animals; and unless these Selenites are perfect fools,=
 they=E2=80=99ll set about now and hunt us till they find us, and when they=
 find us they=E2=80=99ll try and take us if they can, and kill us if they c=
an=E2=80=99t, and that=E2=80=99s the end of the matter. If they take us, th=
ey=E2=80=99ll probably kill us, through some misunderstanding. After we=E2=
=80=99re done for, they may discuss us perhaps, but we shan=E2=80=99t get m=
uch fun out of that.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGo on.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COn the other hand, here=E2=80=99s gold knocking about like c=
ast iron at home. If only we can get some of it back, if only we can find o=
ur sphere again before they do, and get back, then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe might put the thing on a sounder footing. Come back in a =
bigger sphere with guns.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGood Lord!=E2=80=9D cried Cavor, as though that was horrible=
.</p>
			<p>I shied another luminous fungus down the cleft.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook here, Cavor,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve hal=
f the voting power anyhow in this affair, and this is a case for a practica=
l man. I=E2=80=99m a practical man, and you are not. I=E2=80=99m not going =
to trust to Selenites and geometrical diagrams again, if I can help it.=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 That=E2=80=99s all. Get back. Drop all th=
is secrecy=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94or most of it. And come again.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He reflected. =E2=80=9CWhen I came to the moon,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=
=80=9CI ought to have come alone.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe question before the meeting,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Ci=
s how to get back to the sphere.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>For a time we nursed our knees in silence. Then he seemed to decide f=
or my reasons.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI think,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cone can get data. It is =
clear that while the sun is on this side of the moon the air will be blowin=
g through this planet sponge from the dark side hither. On this side, at an=
y rate, the air will be expanding and flowing out of the moon caverns into =
the craters.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Very well, there=E2=80=99s=
 a draught here.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSo there is.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd that means that this is not a dead end; somewhere behind=
 us this cleft goes on and up. The draught is blowing up, and that is the w=
ay we have to go. If we try and get up any sort of chimney or gully there i=
s, we shall not only get out of these passages where they are hunting for u=
s=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut suppose the gully is too narrow?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll come down again.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSsh!=E2=80=9D I said suddenly; =E2=80=9Cwhat=E2=80=99s that?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We listened. At first it was an indistinct murmur, and then one picke=
d out the clang of a gong. =E2=80=9CThey must think we are mooncalves,=E2=
=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cto be frightened at that.=E2=80=9D</p>

			<p>I listened again for a space. =E2=80=9CThis time,=E2=80=9D I whispere=
d, =E2=80=9Cthey=E2=80=99re likely to have some sort of weapon.=E2=80=9D

/p&gt;
			</p><p>I didn=E2=80=99t finish my sentence. I turned about and made a leap o=
ver the fungus tops towards the upper end of the cavity. I saw that the spa=
ce turned upward and became a draughty cleft again, ascending to impenetrab=
le darkness. I was about to clamber up into this, and then with a happy ins=
piration turned back.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat are you doing?=E2=80=9D asked Cavor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGo on!=E2=80=9D said I, and went back and got two of the shi=
ning fungi, and putting one into the breast pocket of my flannel jacket, so=
 that it stuck out to light our climbing, went back with the other for Cavo=
r. The noise of the Selenites was now so loud that it seemed they must be a=
lready beneath the cleft. But it might be they would have difficulty in cla=
mbering into it, or might hesitate to ascend it against our possible resist=
ance. At any rate, we had now the comforting knowledge of the enormous musc=
ular superiority our birth in another planet gave us. In another minute I w=
as clambering with gigantic vigour after Cavor=E2=80=99s blue-lit heels.

			</hgroup>
			<p>I do not know how far we clambered before we came to the grating. It =
may be we ascended only a few hundred feet, but at the time it seemed to me=
 we might have hauled and jammed and hopped and wedged ourselves through a =
mile or more of vertical ascent. Whenever I recall that time, there comes i=
nto my head the heavy clank of our golden chains that followed every moveme=
nt. Very soon my knuckles and knees were raw, and I had a bruise on one che=
ek. After a time the first violence of our efforts diminished, and our move=
ments became more deliberate and less painful. The noise of the pursuing Se=
lenites had died away altogether. It seemed almost as though they had not t=
raced us up the crack after all, in spite of the telltale heap of broken fu=
ngi that must have lain beneath it. At times the cleft narrowed so much tha=
t we could scarce squeeze up it; at others it expanded into great drusy cav=
ities, studded with prickly crystals, or thickly beset with dull, shining f=
ungoid pimples. Sometimes it twisted spirally, and at other times slanted d=
own nearly to the horizontal direction. Ever and again there was the interm=
ittent drip and trickle of water by us. Once or twice it seemed to us that =
small living things had rustled out of our reach, but what they were we nev=
er saw. They may have been venomous beasts for all I know, but they did us =
no harm, and we were now tuned to a pitch when a weird creeping thing more =
or less mattered little. And at last, far above, came the familiar bluish l=
ight again, and then we saw that it filtered through a grating that barred =
our way.</p>
			<p>We whispered as we pointed this out to one another, and became more a=
nd more cautious in our ascent. Presently we were close under the grating, =
and by pressing my face against its bars I could see a limited portion of t=
he cavern beyond. It was clearly a large space, and lit no doubt by some ri=
vulet of the same blue light that we had seen flow from the beating machine=
ry. An intermittent trickle of water dropped ever and again between the bar=
s near my face.</p>
			<p>My first endeavour was naturally to see what might be upon the floor =
of the cavern, but our grating lay in a depression whose rim hid all this f=
rom our eyes. Our foiled attention then fell back upon the suggestion of th=
e various sounds we heard, and presently my eye caught a number of faint sh=
adows that played across the dim roof far overhead.</p>
			<p>Indisputably there were several Selenites, perhaps a considerable num=
ber, in this space, for we could hear the noises of their intercourse, and =
faint sounds that I identified as their footfalls. There was also a success=
ion of regularly repeated sounds=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94<i>chid, chid, chid</i>=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94which began and ceased, suggestive of a knife or spade ha=
cking at some soft substance. Then came a clank as if of chains, a whistle =
and a rumble as of a truck running over a hollowed place, and then again th=
at <i>chid, chid, chid</i> resumed. The shadows told of shapes that moved q=
uickly and rhythmically, in agreement with that regular sound, and rested w=
hen it ceased.</p>
			<p>We put our heads close together, and began to discuss these things in=
 noiseless whispers.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey are occupied,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cthey are occupi=
ed in some way.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re not seeking us, or thinking of us.=E2=80=9D&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CPerhaps they have not heard of us.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThose others are hunting about below. If suddenly we appeare=
d here=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We looked at one another.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThere might be a chance to parley,=E2=80=9D said Cavor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CNot as we are.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>For a space we remained, each occupied by his own thoughts.</p>
			<p><i>Chid, chid, chid</i> went the chopping, and the shadows moved to a=
nd fro.</p>
			<p>I looked at the grating. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s flimsy,=E2=80=9D I sai=
d. =E2=80=9CWe might bend two of the bars and crawl through.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We wasted a little time in vague discussion. Then I took one of the b=
ars in both hands, and got my feet up against the rock until they were almo=
st on a level with my head, and so thrust against the bar. It bent so sudde=
nly that I almost slipped. I clambered about and bent the adjacent bar in t=
he opposite direction, and then took the luminous fungus from my pocket and=
 dropped it down the fissure.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t do anything hastily,=E2=80=9D whispered Cavor,=
 as I twisted myself up through the opening I had enlarged. I had a glimpse=
 of busy figures as I came through the grating, and immediately bent down, =
so that the rim of the depression in which the grating lay hid me from thei=
r eyes, and so lay flat, signalling advice to Cavor as he also prepared to =
come through. Presently we were side by side in the depression, peering ove=
r the edge at the cavern and its occupants.</p>
			<p>It was a much larger cavern than we had supposed from our first glimp=
se of it, and we looked up from the lowest portion of its sloping floor. It=
 widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid the remo=
ter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length, vanishing at =
last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a number of huge shapes,=
 huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were busy. At first they seeme=
d big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted the heads upon them lyi=
ng towards us, eyeless and skinless like the heads of sheep at a butcher=E2=
=80=99s, and perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves being cut up, =
much as the crew of a whaler might cut up a moored whale. They were cutting=
 off the flesh in strips, and on some of the farther trunks the white ribs =
were showing. It was the sound of their hatchets that made that <i>chid, ch=
id</i>. Some way away a thing like a trolley cable, drawn and loaded with c=
hunks of lax meat, was running up the slope of the cavern floor. This enorm=
ous long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food, gave us a sense of =
the vast populousness of the moon world second only to the effect of our fi=
rst glimpse down the shaft.</p>
			<p>It seemed to me at first that the Selenites must be standing on trest=
le-supported planks,<a href="3D&quot;https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-g-wells/=" the-first-men-in-the-moon="" text="" single-page#note-2"="" id="3D&quot;noteref-2&quot;" epub:ty="pe=3D&quot;noteref&quot;">2</a> and then I saw that the planks and supports and their =
hatchets were really of the same leaden hue as my fetters had seemed before=
 white light came to bear on them. A number of very thick-looking crowbars =
lay about the floor, and had apparently assisted to turn the dead mooncalf =
over on its side. They were perhaps six feet long, with shaped handles, ver=
y tempting-looking weapons. The whole place was lit by three transverse str=
eams of the blue fluid.</p>
			<p>We lay for a long time noting all these things in silence. =E2=80=9CW=
ell?=E2=80=9D said Cavor at last.</p>
			<p>I crouched lower and turned to him. I had come upon a brilliant idea.=
 =E2=80=9CUnless they lowered those bodies by a crane,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=
=80=9Cwe must be nearer the surface than I thought.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhy?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe mooncalf doesn=E2=80=99t hop, and it hasn=E2=80=99t got =
wings.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He peered over the edge of the hollow again. =E2=80=9CI wonder now=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D he began. =E2=80=9CAfter all, we=
 have never gone far from the surface=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I stopped him by a grip on his arm. I had heard a noise from the clef=
t below us!</p>
			<p>We twisted ourselves about, and lay as still as death, with every sen=
se alert. In a little while I did not doubt that something was quietly asce=
nding the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I assured myself of a go=
od grip on my chain, and waited for that something to appear.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CJust look at those chaps with the hatchets again,=E2=80=9D I=
 said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re all right,=E2=80=9D said Cavor.</p>
			<p>I took a sort of provisional aim at the gap in the grating. I could h=
ear now quite distinctly the soft twittering of the ascending Selenites, th=
e dab of their hands against the rock, and the falling of dust from their g=
rips as they clambered.</p>
			<p>Then I could see that there was something moving dimly in the blackne=
ss below the grating, but what it might be I could not distinguish. The who=
le thing seemed to hang fire just for a moment=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94then smash!=
 I had sprung to my feet, struck savagely at something that had flashed out=
 at me. It was the keen point of a spear. I have thought since that its len=
gth in the narrowness of the cleft must have prevented its being sloped to =
reach me. Anyhow, it shot out from the grating like the tongue of a snake, =
and missed and flew back and flashed again. But the second time I snatched =
and caught it, and wrenched it away, but not before another had darted inef=
fectually at me.</p>
			<p>I shouted with triumph as I felt the hold of the Selenite resist my p=
ull for a moment and give, and then I was jabbing down through the bars, am=
idst squeals from the darkness, and Cavor had snapped off the other spear, =
and was leaping and flourishing it beside me, and making inefficient jabs. =
Clang, clang, came up through the grating, and then an axe hurtled through =
the air and whacked against the rocks beyond, to remind me of the fleshers =
at the carcasses up the cavern.</p>
			<p>I turned, and they were all coming towards us in open order waving th=
eir axes. They were short, thick, little beggars, with long arms, strikingl=
y different from the ones we had seen before. If they had not heard of us b=
efore, they must have realised the situation with incredible swiftness. I s=
tared at them for a moment, spear in hand. =E2=80=9CGuard that grating, Cav=
or,=E2=80=9D I cried, howled to intimidate them, and rushed to meet them. T=
wo of them missed with their hatchets, and the rest fled incontinently. The=
n the two also were sprinting away up the cavern, with hands clenched and h=
eads down. I never saw men run like them!</p>
			<p>I knew the spear I had was no good for me. It was thin and flimsy, on=
ly effectual for a thrust, and too long for a quick recover. So I only chas=
ed the Selenites as far as the first carcass, and stopped there and picked =
up one of the crowbars that were lying about. It felt comfortingly heavy, a=
nd equal to smashing any number of Selenites. I threw away my spear, and pi=
cked up a second crowbar for the other hand. I felt five times better than =
I had with the spear. I shook the two threateningly at the Selenites, who h=
ad come to a halt in a little crowd far away up the cavern, and then turned=
 about to look at Cavor.</p>
			<p>He was leaping from side to side of the grating, making threatening j=
abs with his broken spear. That was all right. It would keep the Selenites =
down=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94for a time at any rate. I looked up the cavern again.=
 What on earth were we going to do now?</p>
			<p>We were cornered in a sort of way already. But these butchers up the =
cavern had been surprised, they were probably scared, and they had no speci=
al weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs. And that way lay escape. =
Their sturdy little forms=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94ever so much shorter and thicker=
 than the mooncalf herds=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94were scattered up the slope in a =
way that was eloquent of indecision. I had the moral advantage of a mad bul=
l in a street. But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them. V=
ery probably there was. Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some i=
nfernally long spears. It might be they had other surprises for us.=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 But, confound it! if we charged up the cave =
we should let them up behind us, and if we didn=E2=80=99t, those little bru=
tes up the cave would probably get reinforced. Heaven alone knew what treme=
ndous engines of warfare=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoe=
s=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94this unknown world below our feet, this vaster world of =
which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not presently send up to=
 our destruction. It became clear the only thing to do was to charge! It be=
came clearer as the legs of a number of fresh Selenites appeared running do=
wn the cavern towards us.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBedford!=E2=80=9D cried Cavor, and behold! he was halfway be=
tween me and the grating.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGo back!=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=9CWhat are you doing=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99ve got=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s like a gun=
!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>And struggling in the grating between those defensive spears appeared=
 the head and shoulders of a singularly lean and angular Selenite, bearing =
some complicated apparatus.</p>
			<p>I realised Cavor=E2=80=99s utter incapacity for the fight we had in h=
and. For a moment I hesitated. Then I rushed past him whirling my crowbars,=
 and shouting to confound the aim of the Selenite. He was aiming in the que=
erest way with the thing against his stomach. <i>Chuzz!</i> The thing wasn=
=E2=80=99t a gun; it went off like a crossbow more, and dropped me in the m=
iddle of a leap.</p>
			<p>I didn=E2=80=99t fall down, I simply came down a little shorter than =
I should have done if I hadn=E2=80=99t been hit, and from the feel of my sh=
oulder the thing might have tapped me and glanced off. Then my left hand hi=
t against the shaft, and I perceived there was a sort of spear sticking hal=
f through my shoulder. The moment after I got home with the crowbar in my r=
ight hand, and hit the Selenite fair and square. He collapsed=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94he crushed and crumpled=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94his head smashed like an egg=
.</p>
			<p>I dropped a crowbar, pulled the spear out of my shoulder, and began t=
o jab it down the grating into the darkness. At each jab came a shriek and =
twitter. Finally I hurled the spear down upon them with all my strength, le=
apt up, picked up the crowbar again, and started for the multitude up the c=
avern.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBedford!=E2=80=9D cried Cavor. =E2=80=9CBedford!=E2=80=9D as=
 I flew past him.</p>
			<p>I seem to remember his footsteps coming on behind me.</p>
			<p>Step, leap=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 whack, step, leap.=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Each leap seemed to last ages. With each,=
 the cave opened out and the number of Selenites visible increased. At firs=
t they seemed all running about like ants in a disturbed anthill, one or tw=
o waving hatchets and coming to meet me, more running away, some bolting si=
deways into the avenue of carcasses, then presently others came in sight ca=
rrying spears, and then others. I saw a most extraordinary thing, all hands=
 and feet, bolting for cover. The cavern grew darker farther up. Flick! som=
ething flew over my head. Flick! As I soared in mid-stride I saw a spear hi=
t and quiver in one of the carcasses to my left. Then, as I came down, one =
hit the ground before me, and I heard the remote <i>chuzz!</i> with which t=
heir things were fired. Flick, flick! for a moment it was a shower. They we=
re volleying!</p>
			<p>I stopped dead.</p>
			<p>I don=E2=80=99t think I thought clearly then. I seem to remember a ki=
nd of stereotyped phrase running through my mind: =E2=80=9CZone of fire, se=
ek cover!=E2=80=9D I know I made a dash for the space between two of the ca=
rcasses, and stood there panting and feeling very wicked.</p>
			<p>I looked round for Cavor, and for a moment it seemed as if he had van=
ished from the world. Then he came out of the darkness between the row of t=
he carcasses and the rocky wall of the cavern. I saw his little face, dark =
and blue, and shining with perspiration and emotion.</p>
			<p>He was saying something, but what it was I did not heed. I had realis=
ed that we might work from mooncalf to mooncalf up the cave until we were n=
ear enough to charge home. It was charge or nothing. =E2=80=9CCome on!=E2=
=80=9D I said, and led the way.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBedford!=E2=80=9D he cried unavailingly.</p>
			<p>My mind was busy as we went up that narrow alley between the dead bod=
ies and the wall of the cavern. The rocks curved about=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the=
y could not enfilade us. Though in that narrow space we could not leap, yet=
 with our earthborn strength we were still able to go very much faster than=
 the Selenites. I reckoned we should presently come right among them. Once =
we were on them, they would be nearly as formidable as black beetles. Only!=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94there would first of all be a volley. I thought of a stra=
tagem. I whipped off my flannel jacket as I ran.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBedford!=E2=80=9D panted Cavor behind me.</p>
			<p>I glanced back. =E2=80=9CWhat?=E2=80=9D said I.</p>
			<p>He was pointing upward over the carcasses. =E2=80=9CWhite light!=E2=
=80=9D he said. =E2=80=9CWhite light again!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I looked, and it was even so, a faint white ghost of twilight in the =
remoter cavern roof. That seemed to give me double strength.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CKeep close,=E2=80=9D I said. A flat, long Selenite dashed ou=
t of the darkness, and squealed and fled. I halted, and stopped Cavor with =
my hand. I hung my jacket over my crowbar, ducked round the next carcass, d=
ropped jacket and crowbar, showed myself, and darted back.</p>
			<p><i>Chuzz=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94flick</i>, just one arrow came. We were clo=
se on the Selenites, and they were standing in a crowd, broad, short, and t=
all together, with a little battery of their shooting implements pointing d=
own the cave. Three or four other arrows followed the first, and then their=
 fire ceased.</p>
			<p>I stuck out my head, and escaped by a hair=E2=80=99s-breadth. This ti=
me I drew a dozen shots or more, and heard the Selenites shouting and twitt=
ering as if with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket and crowbar ag=
ain.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C<em>Now!</em>=E2=80=9D said I, and thrust out the jacket.
			</p><p><i>Chuzz=E2=80=91zz=E2=80=91zz=E2=80=91zz! Chuzz!</i> In an instant m=
y jacket had grown a thick beard of arrows, and they were quivering all ove=
r the carcass behind us. Instantly I slipped the crowbar out of the jacket,=
 dropped the jacket=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94for all I know to the contrary it is l=
ying up there in the moon now=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and rushed out upon them.
			</p><p>For a minute perhaps it was massacre. I was too fierce to discriminat=
e, and the Selenites were probably too scared to fight. At any rate they ma=
de no sort of fight against me. I saw scarlet, as the saying is. I remember=
 I seemed to be wading among those leathery, thin things as a man wades thr=
ough tall grass, mowing and hitting, first right, then left; smash, smash. =
Little drops of moisture flew about. I trod on things that crushed and pipe=
d and went slippery. The crowd seemed to open and close and flow like water=
. They seemed to have no combined plan whatever. There were spears flew abo=
ut me, I was grazed over the ear by one. I was stabbed once in the arm and =
once in the cheek, but I only found that out afterwards, when the blood had=
 had time to run and cool and feel wet.</p>
			<p>What Cavor did I do not know. For a space it seemed that this fightin=
g had lasted for an age, and must needs go on forever. Then suddenly it was=
 all over, and there was nothing to be seen but the backs of heads bobbing =
up and down as their owners ran in all directions=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=A6 I seemed altogether unhurt. I ran forward some paces, shouting=
, then turned about. I was amazed.</p>
			<p>I had come right through them in vast flying strides, they were all b=
ehind me, and running hither and thither to hide.</p>
			<p>I felt an enormous astonishment at the evaporation of the great fight=
 into which I had hurled myself, and not a little of exultation. It did not=
 seem to me that I had discovered the Selenites were unexpectedly flimsy, b=
ut that I was unexpectedly strong. I laughed stupidly. This fantastic moon!=
</p>
			<p>I glanced for a moment at the smashed and writhing bodies that were s=
cattered over the cavern floor, with a vague idea of further violence, then=
 hurried on after Cavor.</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened on a hazy void. In =
another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that project=
ed into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up=
 and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or p=
rotection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock =
again. Somehow it reminded me then of one of those spiral turns of the rail=
way through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely=
 hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titani=
c effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, an=
d overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, an=
d half of the lip about it well-nigh blinding with the white light of the s=
un. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCome on!=E2=80=9D I said, leading the way.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut there?=E2=80=9D said Cavor, and very carefully stepped n=
earer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward a=
nd looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could=
 see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple=
 floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkne=
ss came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one=E2=
=80=99s ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it=
 may be, four miles beneath our feet.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6<!--

			</p><p>For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and le=
d the way up the gallery.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThis must be the shaft we looked down upon,=E2=80=9D said Ca=
vor. =E2=80=9CUnder that lid.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd below there, is where we saw the lights.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe lights!=E2=80=9D said he. =E2=80=9CYes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=
the lights of the world that now we shall never see.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll come back,=E2=80=9D I said, for now we had esc=
aped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.</p>
			<p>His answer I did not catch.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CEh?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt doesn=E2=80=99t matter,=E2=80=9D he answered, and we hurr=
ied on in silence.</p>
			<p>I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allo=
wing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it =
almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under luna=
r conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our flig=
ht, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong. It was clear th=
at the knowledge of our strength and violence had reached them. Our way to =
the exterior was unexpectedly plain. The spiral gallery straightened into a=
 steeply ascendent tunnel, its floor bearing abundant traces of the mooncal=
ves, and so straight and short in proportion to its vast arch, that no part=
 of it was absolutely dark. Almost immediately it began to lighten, and the=
n far off and high up, and quite blindingly brilliant, appeared its opening=
 on the exterior, a slope of Alpine steepness surmounted by a crest of bayo=
net shrub, tall and broken down now, and dry and dead, in spiky silhouette =
against the sun.</p>
			<p>And it is strange that we men, to whom this very vegetation had seeme=
d so weird and horrible a little time ago, should now behold it with the em=
otion a homecoming exile might feel at sight of his native land. We welcome=
d even the rareness of the air that made us pant as we ran, and which rende=
red speaking no longer the easy thing that it had been, but an effort to ma=
ke oneself heard. Larger grew the sunlit circle above us, and larger, and a=
ll the nearer tunnel sank into a rim of indistinguishable black. We saw the=
 dead bayonet shrub no longer with any touch of green in it, but brown and =
dry and thick, and the shadow of its upper branches high out of sight made =
a densely interlaced pattern upon the tumbled rocks. And at the immediate m=
outh of the tunnel was a wide trampled space where the mooncalves had come =
and gone.</p>
			<p>We came out upon this space at last into a light and heat that hit an=
d pressed upon us. We traversed the exposed area painfully, and clambered u=
p a slope among the scrub stems, and sat down at last panting in a high pla=
ce beneath the shadow of a mass of twisted lava. Even in the shade the rock=
 felt hot.</p>
			<p>The air was intensely hot, and we were in great physical discomfort, =
but for all that we were no longer in a nightmare. We seemed to have come t=
o our own province again, beneath the stars. All the fear and stress of our=
 flight through the dim passages and fissures below had fallen from us. Tha=
t last fight had filled us with an enormous confidence in ourselves so far =
as the Selenites were concerned. We looked back almost incredulously at the=
 black opening from which we had just emerged. Down there it was, in a blue=
 glow that now in our memories seemed the next thing to absolute darkness, =
we had met with things like mad mockeries of men, helmet-headed creatures, =
and had walked in fear before them, and had submitted to them until we coul=
d submit no longer. And, behold, they had smashed like wax and scattered li=
ke chaff, and fled and vanished like the creatures of a dream!</p>
			<p>I rubbed my eyes, doubting whether we had not slept and dreamt these =
things by reason of the fungus we had eaten, and suddenly discovered the bl=
ood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully to my shoul=
der and arm.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConfound it!=E2=80=9D I said, gauging my injuries with an in=
vestigatory hand, and suddenly that distant tunnel mouth became, as it were=
, a watching eye.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I said; =E2=80=9Cwhat are they going to do n=
ow? And what are we going to do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He shook his head, with his eyes fixed upon the tunnel. =E2=80=9CHow =
can one tell what they will do?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt depends on what they think of us, and I don=E2=80=99t see=
 how we can begin to guess that. And it depends upon what they have in rese=
rve. It=E2=80=99s as you say, Cavor, we have touched the merest outside of =
this world. They may have all sorts of things inside here. Even with those =
shooting things they might make it bad for us.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYet after all,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Ceven if we <em>don=
=E2=80=99t</em> find the sphere at once, there is a chance for us. We might=
 hold out. Even through the night. We might go down there again and make a =
fight for it.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I stared about me with speculative eyes. The character of the scenery=
 had altered altogether by reason of the enormous growth and subsequent dry=
ing of the scrub. The crest on which we sat was high, and commanded a wide =
prospect of the crater landscape, and we saw it now all sere and dry in the=
 late autumn of the lunar afternoon. Rising one behind the other were long =
slopes and fields of trampled brown where the mooncalves had pastured, and =
far away in the full blaze of the sun a drove of them basked slumberously, =
scattered shapes, each with a blot of shadow against it like sheep on the s=
ide of a down. But never a sign of a Selenite was to be seen. Whether they =
had fled on our emergence from the interior passages, or whether they were =
accustomed to retire after driving out the mooncalves, I cannot guess. At t=
he time I believed the former was the case.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIf we were to set fire to all this stuff,=E2=80=9D I said, =
=E2=80=9Cwe might find the sphere among the ashes.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Cavor did not seem to hear me. He was peering under his hand at the s=
tars, that still, in spite of the intense sunlight, were abundantly visible=
 in the sky. =E2=80=9CHow long do you think we have been here?=E2=80=9D he =
asked at last.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBeen where?=E2=80=9D</p>

=80=94=E2=80=9D I looked up at the sun for a moment, and then saw that it w=
as halfway from the zenith to the western edge of things. =E2=80=9CFour day=

=A0=E2=80=94we might hoist a flag, or a handkerchief, or something=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=94and quarter the ground, and work round that.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He stood up beside me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cthere is nothing for it but =
to hunt the sphere. Nothing. We may find it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94certainly we m=
ay find it. And if not=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe must keep on looking.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He looked this way and that, glanced up at the sky and down at the tu=
nnel, and astonished me by a sudden gesture of impatience. =E2=80=9COh! but=
 we have done foolishly! To have come to this pass! Think how it might have=
 been, and the things we might have done!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe may do something yet.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNever the thing we might have done. Here below our feet is a=
 world. Think of what that world must be! Think of that machine we saw, and=
 the lid and the shaft! They were just remote outlying things, and those cr=
eatures we have seen and fought with no more than ignorant peasants, dwelle=
rs in the outskirts, yokels and labourers half akin to brutes. Down below! =
Caverns beneath caverns, tunnels, structures, ways.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=A6 It must open out, and be greater and wider and more populous a=
s one descends. Assuredly. Right down at last to the central sea that washe=
s round the core of the moon. Think of its inky waters under the spare ligh=
ts=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94if, indeed, their eyes <em>need</em> lights! Think of t=
he cascading tributaries pouring down their channels to feed it! Think of t=
he tides upon its surface, and the rush and swirl of its ebb and flow! Perh=
aps they have ships that go upon it, perhaps down there are mighty cities a=
nd swarming ways, and wisdom and order passing the wit of man. And we may d=
ie here upon it, and never see the masters who <em>must</em> be=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94ruling over these things! We may freeze and die here, and the air wil=
l freeze and thaw upon us, and then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94! Then they will come =
upon us, come on our stiff and silent bodies, and find the sphere we cannot=
 find, and they will understand at last too late all the thought and effort=
 that ended here in vain!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>His voice for all that speech sounded like the voice of someone heard=
 in a telephone, weak and far away.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut the darkness,=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COne might get over that.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHow?=E2=80=9D</p>

ht understand.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He stood for a moment with his hands held down and a rueful face, sta=
ring out over the waste that defied him. Then with a gesture of renunciatio=
n he turned towards me with proposals for the systematic hunting of the sph=
ere.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe can return,=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>He looked about him. =E2=80=9CFirst of all we shall have to get to ea=

			<p>=E2=80=9CWe can take back an earnest of success in this gold.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>He looked at my golden crowbars, and said nothing for a space. He sto=
od with his hands clasped behind his back, staring across the crater. At la=
st he sighed and spoke. =E2=80=9CIt was <em>I</em> found the way here, but =
to find a way isn=E2=80=99t always to be master of a way. If I take my secr=
et back to earth, what will happen? I do not see how I can keep my secret f=
or a year, for even a part of a year. Sooner or later it must come out, eve=
n if other men rediscover it. And then.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=
 Governments and powers will struggle to get hither, they will fight agains=
t one another, and against these moon people; it will only spread warfare a=
nd multiply the occasions of war. In a little while, in a very little while=
, if I tell my secret, this planet to its deepest galleries will be strewn =
with human dead. Other things are doubtful, but that is certain.=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 It is not as though man had any use for the moo=
n. What good would the moon be to men? Even of their own planet what have t=
hey made but a battleground and theatre of infinite folly? Small as his wor=
ld is, and short as his time, he has still in his little life down there fa=
r more than he can do. No! Science has toiled too long forging weapons for =
fools to use. It is time she held her hand. Let him find it out for himself=
 again=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in a thousand years=E2=80=99 time.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThere are methods of secrecy,=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>He looked up at me and smiled. =E2=80=9CAfter all,=E2=80=9D he said, =
=E2=80=9Cwhy should one worry? There is little chance of our finding the sp=
here, and down below things are brewing. It=E2=80=99s simply the human habi=
t of hoping till we die that makes us think of return. Our troubles are onl=
y beginning. We have shown these moon folk violence, we have given them a t=
aste of our quality, and our chances are about as good as a tiger=E2=80=99s=
 that has got loose and killed a man in Hyde Park. The news of us must be r=
unning down from gallery to gallery, down towards the central parts.=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 No sane beings will ever let us take that sp=
here back to earth after so much as they have seen of us.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe aren=E2=80=99t improving our chances,=E2=80=9D said I, =
=E2=80=9Cby sitting here.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>We stood up side by side.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAfter all,=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cwe must separate. We m=
ust stick up a handkerchief on these tall spikes here and fasten it firmly,=
 and from this as a centre we must work over the crater. You must go westwa=
rd, moving out in semicircles to and fro towards the setting sun. You must =
move first with your shadow on your right until it is at right angles with =
the direction of your handkerchief, and then with your shadow on your left.=
 And I will do the same to the east. We will look into every gully, examine=
 every skerry of rocks; we will do all we can to find my sphere. If we see =
Selenites we will hide from them as well as we can. For drink we must take =
snow, and if we feel the need of food, we must kill a mooncalf if we can, a=
nd eat such flesh as it has=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94raw=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and so ea=
ch will go his own way.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd if one of us comes upon the sphere?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe must come back to the white handkerchief, and stand by it=
 and signal to the other.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd if neither=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>Cavor glanced up at the sun. =E2=80=9CWe go on seeking until the nigh=
t and cold overtake us.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSuppose the Selenites have found the sphere and hidden it?=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COr if presently they come hunting us?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He made no answer.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou had better take a club,=E2=80=9D I said.</p>
			<p>He shook his head, and stared away from me across the waste.</p>
			<p>But for a moment he did not start. He looked round at me shyly, hesit=
ated. =E2=80=9CAu revoir,=E2=80=9D he said.</p>
			<p>I felt an odd stab of emotion. A sense of how we had galled each othe=
r, and particularly how I must have galled him, came to me. =E2=80=9CConfou=
nd it,=E2=80=9D thought I, =E2=80=9Cwe might have done better!=E2=80=9D I w=
as on the point of asking him to shake hands=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94for that, som=
ehow, was how I felt just then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94when he put his feet togeth=
er and leapt away from me towards the north. He seemed to drift through the=
 air as a dead leaf would do, fell lightly, and leapt again. I stood for a =
moment watching him, then faced westward reluctantly, pulled myself togethe=
r, and with something of the feeling of a man who leaps into icy water, sel=
ected a leaping point, and plunged forward to explore my solitary half of t=
he moon world. I dropped rather clumsily among rocks, stood up and looked a=
bout me, clambered on to a rocky slab, and leapt again.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>When presently I looked for Cavor he was hidden from my eyes, but the=
 handkerchief showed out bravely on its headland, white in the blaze of the=
 sun.</p>
			<p>I determined not to lose sight of that handkerchief whatever might be=

			<p>In a little while it seemed to me as though I had always been alone o=
n the moon. I hunted for a time with a certain intentness, but the heat was=
 still very great, and the thinness of the air felt like a hoop about one=
=E2=80=99s chest. I came presently into a hollow basin bristling with tall,=
 brown, dry fronds about its edge, and I sat down under these to rest and c=
ool. I intended to rest for only a little while. I put down my clubs beside=
 me, and sat resting my chin on my hands. I saw with a sort of colourless i=
nterest that the rocks of the basin, where here and there the crackling dry=
 lichens had shrunk away to show them, were all veined and splattered with =
gold, that here and there bosses of rounded and wrinkled gold projected fro=
m among the litter. What did that matter now? A sort of languor had possess=
ion of my limbs and mind, I did not believe for a moment that we should eve=
r find the sphere in that vast desiccated wilderness. I seemed to lack a mo=
tive for effort until the Selenites should come. Then I supposed I should e=
xert myself, obeying that unreasonable imperative that urges a man before a=
ll things to preserve and defend his life, albeit he may preserve it only t=
o die more painfully in a little while.</p>
			<p>Why had we come to the moon?</p>
			<p>The thing presented itself to me as a perplexing problem. What is thi=
s spirit in man that urges him forever to depart from happiness and securit=
y, to toil, to place himself in danger, to risk even a reasonable certainty=
 of death? It dawned upon me up there in the moon as a thing I ought always=
 to have known, that man is not made simply to go about being safe and comf=
ortable and well fed and amused. Almost any man, if you put the thing to hi=
m, not in words, but in the shape of opportunities, will show that he knows=
 as much. Against his interest, against his happiness, he is constantly bei=
ng driven to do unreasonable things. Some force not himself impels him, and=
 go he must. But why? Why? Sitting there in the midst of that useless moon =
gold, amidst the things of another world, I took count of all my life. Assu=
ming I was to die a castaway upon the moon, I failed altogether to see what=
 purpose I had served. I got no light on that point, but at any rate it was=
 clearer to me than it had ever been in my life before that I was not servi=
ng my own purpose, that all my life I had in truth never served the purpose=
s of my private life. Whose purposes, what purposes, was I serving?=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 I ceased to speculate on why we had come to =
the moon, and took a wider sweep. Why had I come to the earth? Why had I a =
private life at all?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 I lost myself at l=
ast in bottomless speculations.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>My thoughts became vague and cloudy, no longer leading in definite di=
rections. I had not felt heavy or weary=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I cannot imagine o=
ne doing so upon the moon=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94but I suppose I was greatly fati=
gued. At any rate I slept.</p>
			<p>Slumbering there rested me greatly, I think, and the sun was setting =
and the violence of the heat abating, through all the time I slumbered. Whe=
n at last I was roused from my slumbers by a remote clamour, I felt active =
and capable again. I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms. I rose to my fee=
t=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I was a little stiff=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and at once prepar=
ed to resume my search. I shouldered my golden clubs, one on each shoulder,=
 and went on out of the ravine of the gold-veined rocks.</p>
			<p>The sun was certainly lower, much lower than it had been; the air was=
 very much cooler. I perceived I must have slept some time. It seemed to me=
 that a faint touch of misty blueness hung about the western cliff. I leapt=
 to a little boss of rock and surveyed the crater. I could see no signs of =
mooncalves or Selenites, nor could I see Cavor, but I could see my handkerc=
hief afar off, spread out on its thicket of thorns. I looked about me, and =
then leapt forward to the next convenient viewpoint.</p>
			<p>I beat my way round in a semicircle, and back again in a still remote=
r crescent. It was very fatiguing and hopeless. The air was really very muc=
h cooler, and it seemed to me that the shadow under the westward cliff was =
growing broad. Ever and again I stopped and reconnoitred, but there was no =
sign of Cavor, no sign of Selenites; and it seemed to me the mooncalves mus=
t have been driven into the interior again=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I could see non=
e of them. I became more and more desirous of seeing Cavor. The winged outl=
ine of the sun had sunk now, until it was scarcely the distance of its diam=
eter from the rim of the sky. I was oppressed by the idea that the Selenite=
s would presently close their lids and valves, and shut us out under the in=
exorable onrush of the lunar night. It seemed to me high time that he aband=
oned his search, and that we took counsel together. I felt how urgent it wa=
s that we should decide soon upon our course. We had failed to find the sph=
ere, we no longer had time to seek it, and once these valves were closed wi=
th us outside, we were lost men. The great night of space would descend upo=
n us=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94that blackness of the void which is the only absolute=
 death. All my being shrank from that approach. We must get into the moon a=
gain, though we were slain in doing it. I was haunted by a vision of our fr=
eezing to death, of our hammering with our last strength on the valve of th=
e great pit.</p>
			<p>I took no thought any more of the sphere. I thought only of finding C=
avor again. I was half inclined to go back into the moon without him, rathe=
r than seek him until it was too late. I was already halfway back towards o=
ur handkerchief, when suddenly=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94</p>
			<p>I saw the sphere!</p>
			<p>I did not find it so much as it found me. It was lying much further t=
o the westward than I had gone, and the sloping rays of the sinking sun ref=
lected from its glass had suddenly proclaimed its presence in a dazzling be=
am. For an instant I thought this was some new device of the Selenites agai=
nst us, and then I understood.</p>
			<p>I threw up my arms, shouted a ghostly shout, and set off in vast leap=
s towards it. I missed one of my leaps and dropped into a deep ravine and t=
wisted my ankle, and after that I stumbled at almost every leap. I was in a=
 state of hysterical agitation, trembling violently, and quite breathless l=
ong before I got to it. Three times at least I had to stop with my hands re=
sting on my side, and spite of the thin dryness of the air, the perspiratio=
n was wet upon my face.</p>
			<p>I thought of nothing but the sphere until I reached it, I forgot even=
 my trouble of Cavor=E2=80=99s whereabouts. My last leap flung me with my h=
ands hard against its glass; then I lay against it panting, and trying vain=
ly to shout, =E2=80=9CCavor! here is the sphere!=E2=80=9D When I had recove=
red a little I peered through the thick glass, and the things inside seemed=
 tumbled. I stooped to peer closer. Then I attempted to get in. I had to ho=
ist it over a little to get my head through the manhole. The screw stopper =
was inside, and I could see now that nothing had been touched, nothing had =
suffered. It lay there as we had left it when we had dropped out amidst the=
 snow. For a time I was wholly occupied in making and remaking this invento=
ry. I found I was trembling violently. It was good to see that familiar dar=
k interior again! I cannot tell you how good. Presently I crept inside and =
sat down among the things. I looked through the glass at the moon world and=
 shivered. I placed my gold clubs upon the bale, and sought out and took a =
little food; not so much because I wanted it, but because it was there. The=
n it occurred to me that it was time to go out and signal for Cavor. But I =
did not go out and signal for Cavor forthwith. Something held me to the sph=
ere.</p>
			<p>After all, everything was coming right. There would be still time for=
 us to get more of the magic stone that gives one mastery over men. Away th=
ere, close handy, was gold for the picking up; and the sphere would travel =
as well half full of gold as though it were empty. We could go back now, ma=
sters of ourselves and our world, and then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94</p>
			<p>I roused myself at last, and with an effort got myself out of the sph=
ere. I shivered as I emerged, for the evening air was growing very cold. I =
stood in the hollow staring about me. I scrutinised the bushes round me ver=
y carefully before I leapt to the rocky shelf hard by, and took once more w=
hat had been my first leap in the moon. But now I made it with no effort wh=
atever.</p>
			<p>The growth and decay of the vegetation had gone on apace, and the who=
le aspect of the rocks had changed, but still it was possible to make out t=
he slope on which the seeds had germinated, and the rocky mass from which w=
e had taken our first view of the crater. But the spiky shrub on the slope =
stood brown and sere now, and thirty feet high, and cast long shadows that =
stretched out of sight, and the little seeds that clustered in its upper br=
anches were brown and ripe. Its work was done, and it was brittle and ready=
 to fall and crumple under the freezing air, so soon as the nightfall came.=
 And the huge cacti, that had swollen as we watched them, had long since bu=
rst and scattered their spores to the four quarters of the moon. Amazing li=
ttle corner in the universe=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the landing-place of men!</p>
			<p>Some day, thought I, I will have an inscription standing there right =
in the midst of the hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world withi=
n knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult would becom=
e!</p>
			<p>But as yet it could scarcely be dreaming of the significance of our c=
oming. For if it did, the crater would surely be an uproar of pursuit, inst=
ead of as still as death! I looked about for some place from which I might =
signal to Cavor, and saw that same patch of rock to which he had leapt from=
 my present standpoint, still bare and barren in the sun. For a moment I he=
sitated at going so far from the sphere. Then with a pang of shame at that =
hesitation, I leapt.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>From this vantage point I surveyed the crater again. Far away at the =
top of the enormous shadow I cast was the little white handkerchief flutter=
ing on the bushes. It was very little and very far, and Cavor was not in si=
ght. It seemed to me that by this time he ought to be looking for me. That =
was the agreement. But he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>I stood waiting and watching, hands shading my eyes, expecting every =
moment to distinguish him. Very probably I stood there for quite a long tim=
e. I tried to shout, and was reminded of the thinness of the air. I made an=
 undecided step back towards the sphere. But a lurking dread of the Selenit=
es made me hesitate to signal my whereabouts by hoisting one of our sleepin=
g-blankets on to the adjacent scrub. I searched the crater again.</p>
			<p>It had an effect of emptiness that chilled me. And it was still! Any =
sound from the Selenites in the world beneath, even had died away. It was a=
s still as death. Save for the faint stir of the shrub about me in the litt=
le breeze that was rising, there was no sound nor shadow of a sound. And th=
e breeze blew chill.</p>
			<p>Confound Cavor!</p>
			<p>I took a deep breath. I put my hands to the sides of my mouth. =E2=80=
=9CCavor!=E2=80=9D I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin shouting f=
ar away.</p>
			<p>I looked at the handkerchief, I looked behind me at the broadening sh=
adow of the westward cliff, I looked under my hand at the sun. It seemed to=
 me that almost visibly it was creeping down the sky.</p>
			<p>I felt I must act instantly if I was to save Cavor. I whipped off my =
vest and flung it as a mark on the sere bayonets of the shrubs behind me, a=
nd then set off in a straight line towards the handkerchief. Perhaps it was=
 a couple of miles away=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a matter of a few hundred leaps an=
d strides. I have already told how one seemed to hang through those lunar l=
eaps. In each suspense I sought Cavor, and marvelled why he should be hidde=
n. In each leap I could feel the sun setting behind me. Each time I touched=
 the ground I was tempted to go back.</p>
			<p>A last leap and I was in the depression below our handkerchief, a str=
ide, and I stood on our former vantage point within arm=E2=80=99s reach of =
it. I stood up straight and scanned the world about me, between its lengthe=
ning bars of shadow. Far away, down a long declivity, was the opening of th=
e tunnel up which we had fled, and my shadow reached towards it, stretched =
towards it, and touched it, like a finger of the night.</p>
			<p>Not a sign of Cavor, not a sound in all the stillness, only that the =
stir and waving of the scrub and of the shadows increased. And suddenly and=
 violently I shivered. =E2=80=9CCav=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D I began, and=
 realised once more the uselessness of the human voice in that thin air.
			</p><p>Silence. The silence of death.</p>
			<p>Then it was my eye caught something=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a little thing, =
lying perhaps fifty yards away down the slope, amidst a litter of bent and =
broken branches. What was it? I knew, and yet for some reason I would not k=
now.</p>
			<p>I went nearer to it. It was the little cricket-cap Cavor had worn. I =
did not touch it, I stood looking at it.</p>
			<p>I saw then that the scattered branches about it had been forcibly sma=
shed and trampled. I hesitated, stepped forward and picked it up.</p>
			<p>I stood with Cavor=E2=80=99s cap in my hand, staring at the trampled =
reeds and thorns about me. On some of them were little smears of something =
dark, something that I dared not touch. A dozen yards away, perhaps, the ri=
sing breeze dragged something into view, something small and vividly white.=
</p>
			<p>It was a little piece of paper crumpled tightly, as though it had bee=
n clutched tightly. I picked it up, and on it were smears of red. My eye ca=
ught faint pencil marks. I smoothed it out, and saw uneven and broken writi=
ng ending at last in a crooked streak upon the paper.</p>
			<p>I set myself to decipher this.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI have been injured about the knee, I think my kneecap is hu=
rt, and I cannot run or crawl,=E2=80=9D it began=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94pretty di=

			<p>Then less legibly: =E2=80=9CThey have been chasing me for some time, =

			<p>Then the writing became convulsive. =E2=80=9CI can hear them,=E2=80=
=9D I guessed the tracing meant, and then it was quite unreadable for a spa=
ce. Then came a little string of words that were quite distinct: =E2=80=9Ca=

			<p>Then came the sudden streak of the pencil across the paper, and on th=
e back and edges=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94blood!</p>
			<p>And as I stood there stupid and perplexed, with this dumbfounding rel=
ic in my hand, something very soft and light and chill touched my hand for =
a moment and ceased to be, and then a thing, a little white speck, drifted =
athwart a shadow. It was a tiny snowflake, the first snowflake, the herald =
of the night.</p>
			<p>I looked up with a start, and the sky had darkened now almost to blac=
kness, and was thick with a gathering multitude of coldly watchful stars. I=
 looked eastward, and the light of that shrivelled world was touched with a=
 sombre bronze; westward, and the sun, robbed now by a thickening white mis=
t of half its heat and splendour, was touching the crater rim, was sinking =
out of sight, and all the shrubs and jagged and tumbled rocks stood out aga=
inst it in a bristling disorder of black shapes. Into the great lake of dar=
kness westward, a vast wreath of mist was sinking. A cold wind set all the =
crater shivering. Suddenly, for a moment, I was in a puff of falling snow, =
and all the world about me grey and dim.</p>
			<p>And then it was I heard, not loud and penetrating as at first, but fa=
int and dim like a dying voice, that tolling, that same tolling that had we=
lcomed the coming of the day: <i>Boom!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 =
Boom!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Boom!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=A6</i></p>
			<p>It echoed about the crater, it seemed to throb with the throbbing of =
the greater stars, the bloodred crescent of the sun=E2=80=99s disk sank as =
it tolled out: <i>Boom!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Boom!=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Boom!</i></p>
			<p>What had happened to Cavor? All through that tolling I stood there st=
upidly, and at last the tolling ceased.</p>
			<p>And suddenly the open mouth of the tunnel down below there, shut like=
 an eye and vanished out of sight.</p>
			<p>Then indeed was I alone.</p>
			<p>Over me, around me, closing in on me, embracing me ever nearer, was t=
he Eternal; that which was before the beginning, and that which triumphs ov=
er the end; that enormous void in which all light and life and being is but=
 the thin and vanishing splendour of a falling star, the cold, the stillnes=
s, the silence=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the infinite and final Night of space.</p>
			<p>The sense of solitude and desolation became the sense of an overwhelm=
ing presence that stooped towards me, that almost touched me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CNo,=E2=80=9D I cried. =E2=80=9C<em>No!</em> Not yet! not yet=
! Wait! Wait! Oh wait!=E2=80=9D My voice went up to a shriek. I flung the c=
rumpled paper from me, scrambled back to the crest to take my bearings, and=
 then, with all the will that was in me, leapt out towards the mark I had l=
eft, dim and distant now in the very margin of the shadow.</p>
			<p>Leap, leap, leap, and each leap was seven ages.</p>
			<p>Before me the pale serpent-girdled section of the sun sank and sank, =
and the advancing shadow swept to seize the sphere before I could reach it.=
 I was two miles away, a hundred leaps or more, and the air about me was th=
inning out as it thins under an air-pump, and the cold was gripping at my j=
oints. But had I died, I should have died leaping. Once, and then again my =
foot slipped on the gathering snow as I leapt and shortened my leap; once I=
 fell short into bushes that crashed and smashed into dusty chips and nothi=
ngness, and once I stumbled as I dropped, and rolled head over heels into a=
 gully, and rose bruised and bleeding and confused as to my direction.</p>
			<p>But such incidents were as nothing to the intervals, those awful paus=
es when one drifted through the air towards that pouring tide of night. My =
breathing made a piping noise, and it was as though knives were whirling in=
 my lungs. My heart seemed to beat against the top of my brain. =E2=80=9CSh=
all I reach it? O Heaven! shall I reach it?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>My whole being became anguish.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLie down!=E2=80=9D screamed my pain and despair; =E2=80=9Cli=
e down!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>The nearer I struggled, the more awfully remote it seemed. I was numb=
, I stumbled, I bruised and cut myself and did not bleed.</p>
			<p>It was in sight.</p>
			<p>I fell on all fours, and my lungs whooped.</p>
			<p>I crawled. The frost gathered on my lips, icicles hung from my mousta=
che, I was white with the freezing atmosphere.</p>
			<p>I was a dozen yards from it. My eyes had become dim. =E2=80=9CLie dow=
n!=E2=80=9D screamed despair; =E2=80=9Clie down!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I touched it, and halted. =E2=80=9CToo late!=E2=80=9D screamed despai=
r; =E2=80=9Clie down!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I fought stiffly with it. I was on the manhole lip, a stupefied, half=
-dead being. The snow was all about me. I pulled myself in. There lurked wi=
thin a little warmer air.</p>
			<p>The snowflakes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the airflakes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94danced=
 in about me, as I tried with chilling hands to thrust the valve in and spu=
n it tight and hard. I sobbed. =E2=80=9CI will,=E2=80=9D I chattered in my =
teeth. And then, with fingers that quivered and felt brittle, I turned to t=
he shutter studs.</p>
			<p>As I fumbled with the switches=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94for I had never contr=
olled them before=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I could see dimly through the steaming g=
lass the blazing red streamers of the sinking sun, dancing and flickering t=
hrough the snowstorm, and the black forms of the scrub thickening and bendi=
ng and breaking beneath the accumulating snow. Thicker whirled the snow and=
 thicker, black against the light. What if even now the switches overcame m=
e?</p>
			<p>Then something clicked under my hands, and in an instant that last vi=
sion of the moon world was hidden from my eyes. I was in the silence and da=
rkness of the interplanetary sphere.</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>It was almost as though I had been killed. Indeed, I could imagine a =
man suddenly and violently killed would feel very much as I did. One moment=
, a passion of agonising existence and fear; the next, darkness and stillne=
ss, neither light nor life nor sun, moon nor stars, the blank infinite. Alt=
hough the thing was done by my own act, although I had already tasted this =
very effect in Cavor=E2=80=99s company, I felt astonished, dumbfounded, and=
 overwhelmed. I seemed to be borne upward into an enormous darkness. My fin=
gers floated off the studs, I hung as if I were annihilated, and at last ve=
ry softly and gently I came against the bale and the golden chain, and the =
crowbars that had drifted to the middle of the sphere.</p>
			<p>I do not know how long that drifting took. In the sphere of course, e=
ven more than on the moon, one=E2=80=99s earthly time sense was ineffectual=
. At the touch of the bale it was as if I had awakened from a dreamless sle=
ep. I immediately perceived that if I wanted to keep awake and alive I must=
 get a light or open a window, so as to get a grip of something with my eye=
s. And besides I was cold. I kicked off from the bale, therefore, clawed on=
 to the thin cords within the glass, crawled along until I got to the manho=
le rim, and so got my bearings for the light and blind studs, took a shove =
off, and flying once round the bale, and getting a scare from something big=
 and flimsy that was drifting loose, I got my hand on the cord quite close =
to the studs, and reached them. I lit the little lamp first of all to see w=
hat it was I had collided with, and discovered that old copy of <i epub:typ="e=3D&quot;se:name.publication.newspaper&quot;">Lloyd=E2=80=99s News</i> had slipped it=
s moorings, and was adrift in the void. That brought me out of the infinite=
 to my own proper dimensions again. It made me laugh and pant for a time, a=
nd suggested the idea of a little oxygen from one of the cylinders. After t=
hat I lit the heater until I felt warm, and then I took food. Then I set to=
 work in a very gingerly fashion on the Cavorite blinds, to see if I could =
guess by any means how the sphere was travelling.</p>
			<p>The first blind I opened I shut at once, and hung for a time flattene=
d and blinded by the sunlight that had hit me. After thinking a little I st=
arted upon the windows at right angles to this one, and got the huge cresce=
nt moon and the little crescent earth behind it, the second time. I was ama=
zed to find how far I was from the moon. I had reckoned that not only shoul=
d I have little or none of the =E2=80=9Ckickoff=E2=80=9D that the earth=E2=
=80=99s atmosphere had given us at our start, but that the tangential =E2=
=80=9Cfly off=E2=80=9D of the moon=E2=80=99s spin would be at least twenty-=
eight times less than the earth=E2=80=99s. I had expected to discover mysel=
f hanging over our crater, and on the edge of the night, but all that was n=
ow only a part of the outline of the white crescent that filled the sky. An=
d Cavor=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94?</p>
			<p>He was already infinitesimal.</p>
			<p>I tried to imagine what could have happened to him. But at that time =
I could think of nothing but death. I seemed to see him, bent and smashed a=
t the foot of some interminably high cascade of blue. And all about him the=
 stupid insects stared.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>Under the inspiring touch of the drifting newspaper I became practica=
l again for a while. It was quite clear to me that what I had to do was to =
get back to earth, but as far as I could see I was drifting away from it. W=
hatever had happened to Cavor, even if he was still alive, which seemed to =
me incredible after that bloodstained scrap, I was powerless to help him. T=
here he was, living or dead behind the mantle of that rayless night, and th=
ere he must remain at least until I could summon our fellow-men to his assi=
stance. Should I do that? Something of the sort I had in my mind; to come b=
ack to earth if it were possible, and then as maturer consideration might d=
etermine, either to show and explain the sphere to a few discreet persons, =
and act with them, or else to keep my secret, sell my gold, obtain weapons,=
 provisions, and an assistant, and return with these advantages to deal on =
equal terms with the flimsy people of the moon, to rescue Cavor, if that we=
re still possible, and at any rate to procure a sufficient supply of gold t=
o place my subsequent proceedings on a firmer basis. But that was hoping fa=
r, I had first to get back.</p>
			<p>I set myself to decide just exactly how the return to earth could be =
contrived. As I struggled with that problem I ceased to worry about what I =
should do when I got there. At last my only care was to get back.</p>
			<p>I puzzled out at last that my best chance would be to drop back towar=
ds the moon as near as I dared in order to gather velocity, then to shut my=
 windows and fly behind it, and when I was past to open my earthward window=
s, and so get off at a good pace homeward. But whether I should ever reach =
the earth by that device, or whether I might not simply find myself spinnin=
g about it in some hyperbolic or parabolic curve or other, I could not tell=
. Later I had a happy inspiration, and by opening certain windows to the mo=
on, which had appeared in the sky in front of the earth, I turned my course=
 aside so as to head off the earth, which it had become evident to me I mus=
t pass behind without some such expedient. I did a very great deal of compl=
icated thinking over these problems=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94for I am no mathematic=
ian=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and in the end I am certain it was much more my good l=
uck than my reasoning that enabled me to hit the earth. Had I known then, a=
s I know now, the mathematical chances there were against me, I doubt if I =
should have troubled even to touch the studs to make any attempt. And havin=
g puzzled out what I considered to be the thing to do, I opened all my moon=
ward windows, and squatted down=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the effort lifted me for a=
 time some feet or so into the air, and I hung there in the oddest way=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94and waited for the crescent to get bigger and bigger until I=
 felt I was near enough for safety. Then I would shut the windows, fly past=
 the moon with the velocity I had got from it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94if I did not=
 smash upon it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and so go on towards the earth.</p>
			<p>And that is what I did.</p>
			<p>At last I felt my moonward start was sufficient. I shut out the sight=
 of the moon from my eyes, and in a state of mind that was, I now recall, i=
ncredibly free from anxiety or any distressful quality, I sat down to begin=
 a vigil in that little speck of matter in infinite space that would last u=
ntil I should strike the earth. The heater had made the sphere tolerably wa=
rm, the air had been refreshed by the oxygen, and except for that faint con=
gestion of the head that was always with me while I was away from earth, I =
felt entire physical comfort. I had extinguished the light again, lest it s=
hould fail me in the end; I was in darkness, save for the earthshine and th=
e glitter of the stars below me. Everything was so absolutely silent and st=
ill that I might indeed have been the only being in the universe, and yet, =
strangely enough, I had no more feeling of loneliness or fear than if I had=
 been lying in bed on earth. Now, this seems all the stranger to me, since =
during my last hours in that crater of the moon, the sense of my utter lone=
liness had been an agony.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>Incredible as it will seem, this interval of time that I spent in spa=
ce has no sort of proportion to any other interval of time in my life. Some=
times it seemed as though I sat through immeasurable eternities like some g=
od upon a lotus leaf, and again as though there was a momentary pause as I =
leapt from moon to earth. In truth, it was altogether some weeks of earthly=
 time. But I had done with care and anxiety, hunger or fear, for that space=
. I floated, thinking with a strange breadth and freedom of all that we had=
 undergone, and of all my life and motives, and the secret issues of my bei=
ng. I seemed to myself to have grown greater and greater, to have lost all =
sense of movement; to be floating amidst the stars, and always the sense of=
 earth=E2=80=99s littleness and the infinite littleness of my life upon it,=
 was implicit in my thoughts.</p>
			<p>I can=E2=80=99t profess to explain the things that happened in my min=
d. No doubt they could all be traced directly or indirectly to the curious =
physical conditions under which I was living. I set them down here just for=
 what they are worth, and without any comment. The most prominent quality o=
f it was a pervading doubt of my own identity. I became, if I may so expres=
s it, dissociate from Bedford; I looked down on Bedford as a trivial, incid=
ental thing with which I chanced to be connected. I saw Bedford in many rel=
ations=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94as an ass or as a poor beast, where I had hitherto =
been inclined to regard him with a quiet pride as a very spirited or rather=
 forcible person. I saw him not only as an ass, but as the son of many gene=
rations of asses. I reviewed his schooldays and his early manhood, and his =
first encounter with love, very much as one might review the proceedings of=
 an ant in the sand.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Something of that =
period of lucidity I regret still hangs about me, and I doubt if I shall ev=
er recover the full-bodied self-satisfaction of my early days. But at the t=
ime the thing was not in the least painful, because I had that extraordinar=
y persuasion that, as a matter of fact, I was no more Bedford than I was an=
yone else, but only a mind floating in the still serenity of space. Why sho=
uld I be disturbed about this Bedford=E2=80=99s shortcomings? I was not res=
ponsible for him or them.</p>
			<p>For a time I struggled against this really very grotesque delusion. I=
 tried to summon the memory of vivid moments, of tender or intense emotions=
 to my assistance; I felt that if I could recall one genuine twinge of feel=
ing the growing severance would be stopped. But I could not do it. I saw Be=
dford rushing down Chancery Lane, hat on the back of his head, coat tails f=
lying out, en route for his public examination. I saw him dodging and bumpi=
ng against, and even saluting, other similar little creatures in that swarm=
ing gutter of people. Me? I saw Bedford that same evening in the sitting-ro=
om of a certain lady, and his hat was on the table beside him, and it wante=
d brushing badly, and he was in tears. Me? I saw him with that lady in vari=
ous attitudes and emotions=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I never felt so detached before=
.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 I saw him hurrying off to Lympne to w=
rite a play, and accosting Cavor, and in his shirt sleeves working at the s=
phere, and walking out to Canterbury because he was afraid to come! Me? I d=
id not believe it.</p>
			<p>I still reasoned that all this was hallucination due to my solitude, =
and the fact that I had lost all weight and sense of resistance. I endeavou=
red to recover that sense by banging myself about the sphere, by pinching m=
y hands and clasping them together. Among other things I lit the light, cap=
tured that torn copy of <i epub:type="3D&quot;se:name.publication.newspaper&quot;">Lloy=
d=E2=80=99s</i>, and read those convincingly realistic advertisements again=
 about the Cutaway bicycle, and the gentleman of private means, and the lad=
y in distress who was selling those =E2=80=9Cforks and spoons.=E2=80=9D The=
re was no doubt they existed surely enough, and, said I, =E2=80=9CThis is y=
our world, and you are Bedford, and you are going back to live among things=
 like that for all the rest of your life.=E2=80=9D But the doubts within me=
 could still argue: =E2=80=9CIt is not you that is reading, it is Bedford, =
but you are not Bedford, you know. That=E2=80=99s just where the mistake co=
mes in.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConfound it!=E2=80=9D I cried; =E2=80=9Cand if I am not Bedf=
ord, what am I?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest =
fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions, like shadows =
seen from far away.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 Do you know, I had =
a sort of idea that really I was something quite outside not only the world=
, but all worlds, and out of space and time, and that this poor Bedford was=
 just a peephole through which I looked at life?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>Bedford! However I disavowed him, there I was most certainly bound up=
 with him, and I knew that wherever or whatever I might be, I must needs fe=
el the stress of his desires, and sympathise with all his joys and sorrows =
until his life should end. And with the dying of Bedford=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94w=
hat then?=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>Enough of this remarkable phase of my experiences! I tell it here sim=
ply to show how one=E2=80=99s isolation and departure from this planet touc=
hed not only the functions and feeling of every organ of the body, but inde=
ed also the very fabric of the mind, with strange and unanticipated disturb=
ances. All through the major portion of that vast space journey I hung thin=
king of such immaterial things as these, hung dissociated and apathetic, a =
cloudy megalomaniac, as it were, amidst the stars and planets in the void o=
f space; and not only the world to which I was returning, but the blue-lit =
caverns of the Selenites, their helmet faces, their gigantic and wonderful =
machines, and the fate of Cavor, dragged helpless into that world, seemed i=
nfinitely minute and altogether trivial things to me.</p>
			<p>Until at last I began to feel the pull of the earth upon my being, dr=
awing me back again to the life that is real for men. And then, indeed, it =
grew clearer and clearer to me that I was quite certainly Bedford after all=
, and returning after amazing adventures to this world of ours, and with a =
life that I was very likely to lose in this return. I set myself to puzzle =
out the conditions under which I must fall to earth.</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>My line of flight was about parallel with the surface as I came into =
the upper air. The temperature of the sphere began to rise forthwith. I kne=
w it behoved me to drop at once. Far below me, in a darkling twilight, stre=
tched a great expanse of sea. I opened every window I could, and fell=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94out of sunshine into evening, and out of evening into night. Va=
ster grew the earth and vaster, swallowing up the stars, and the silvery tr=
anslucent starlit veil of cloud it wore spread out to catch me. At last the=
 world seemed no longer a sphere but flat, and then concave. It was no long=
er a planet in the sky, but the world of Man. I shut all but an inch or so =
of earthward window, and dropped with a slackening velocity. The broadening=
 water, now so near that I could see the dark glitter of the waves, rushed =
up to meet me. The sphere became very hot. I snapped the last strip of wind=
ow, and sat scowling and biting my knuckles, waiting for the impact.=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>The sphere hit the water with a huge splash: it must have sent it fat=
homs high. At the splash I flung the Cavorite shutters open. Down I went, b=
ut slower and slower, and then I felt the sphere pressing against my feet, =
and so drove up again as a bubble drives. And at the last I was floating an=
d rocking upon the surface of the sea, and my journey in space was at an en=
d.</p>
			<p>The night was dark and overcast. Two yellow pinpoints far away showed=
 the passing of a ship, and nearer was a red glare that came and went. Had =
not the electricity of my glow-lamp exhausted itself, I could have got pick=
ed up that night. In spite of the inordinate fatigue I was beginning to fee=
l, I was excited now, and for a time hopeful, in a feverish, impatient way,=
 that so my travelling might end.</p>
			<p>But at last I ceased to move about, and sat, wrists on knees, staring=
 at a distant red light. It swayed up and down, rocking, rocking. My excite=
ment passed. I realised I had yet to spend another night at least in the sp=
here. I perceived myself infinitely heavy and fatigued. And so I fell aslee=
p.</p>
			<p>A change in my rhythmic motion awakened me. I peered through the refr=
acting glass, and saw that I had come aground upon a huge shallow of sand. =
Far away I seemed to see houses and trees, and seaward a curved, vague dist=
ortion of a ship hung between sea and sky.</p>
			<p>I stood up and staggered. My one desire was to emerge. The manhole wa=
s upward, and I wrestled with the screw. Slowly I opened the manhole. At la=
st the air was singing in again as once it had sung out. But this time I di=
d not wait until the pressure was adjusted. In another moment I had the wei=
ght of the window on my hands, and I was open, wide open, to the old famili=
ar sky of earth.</p>
			<p>The air hit me on the chest so that I gasped. I dropped the glass scr=
ew. I cried out, put my hands to my chest, and sat down. For a time I was i=
n pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move about again=
.</p>
			<p>I tried to thrust my head through the manhole, and the sphere rolled =
over. It was as though something had lugged my head down directly it emerge=
d. I ducked back sharply, or I should have been pinned face under water. Af=
ter some wriggling and shoving I managed to crawl out upon sand, over which=
 the retreating waves still came and went.</p>
			<p>I did not attempt to stand up. It seemed to me that my body must be s=
uddenly changed to lead. Mother Earth had her grip on me now=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94no Cavorite intervening. I sat down heedless of the water that came over=
 my feet.</p>
			<p>It was dawn, a grey dawn, rather overcast, but showing here and there=
 a long patch of greenish grey. Some way out a ship was lying at anchor, a =
pale silhouette of a ship with one yellow light. The water came rippling in=
 in long shallow waves. Away to the right curved the land, a shingle bank w=
ith little hovels, and at last a lighthouse, a sailing mark and a point. In=
land stretched a space of level sand, broken here and there by pools of wat=
er, and ending a mile away perhaps in a low shore of scrub. To the northeas=
t some isolated watering-place was visible, a row of gaunt lodging-houses, =
the tallest things that I could see on earth, dull dabs against the brighte=
ning sky. What strange men can have reared these vertical piles in such an =
amplitude of space I do not know. There they are, like pieces of Brighton l=
ost in the waste.</p>
			<p>For a long time I sat there, yawning and rubbing my face. At last I s=
truggled to rise. It made me feel that I was lifting a weight. I stood up.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>I stared at the distant houses. For the first time since our starvati=
on in the crater I thought of earthly food. =E2=80=9CBacon,=E2=80=9D I whis=
pered, =E2=80=9Ceggs. Good toast and good coffee.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=A6 And how the devil am I going to get all this stuff to Lympne?=
=E2=80=9D I wondered where I was. It was an east shore anyhow, and I had se=
en Europe before I dropped.</p>
			<p>I heard footsteps scrunching in the sand, and a little round-faced, f=
riendly-looking man in flannels, with a bathing towel wrapped about his sho=
ulders, and his bathing dress over his arm, appeared up the beach. I knew i=
nstantly that I must be in England. He was staring almost intently at the s=
phere and me. He advanced staring. I daresay I looked a ferocious savage en=
ough=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94dirty, unkempt, to an indescribable degree; but it di=
d not occur to me at the time. He stopped at a distance of twenty yards. =
=E2=80=9CHul=E2=80=91lo, my man!=E2=80=9D he said doubtfully.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHullo yourself!=E2=80=9D said I.</p>
			<p>He advanced, reassured by that. =E2=80=9CWhat on earth is that thing?=
=E2=80=9D he asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCan you tell me where I am?=E2=80=9D I asked.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s Littlestone,=E2=80=9D he said, pointing to th=
e houses; =E2=80=9Cand that=E2=80=99s Dungeness! Have you just landed? What=
=E2=80=99s that thing you=E2=80=99ve got? Some sort of machine?=E2=80=9D
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CYes.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHave you floated ashore? Have you been wrecked or something?=
 What is it?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I meditated swiftly. I made an estimate of the little man=E2=80=99s a=
ppearance as he drew nearer. =E2=80=9CBy Jove!=E2=80=9D he said, =E2=80=9Cy=
ou=E2=80=99ve had a time of it! I thought you=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94Well=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94Where were you cast away? Is that thing a sort of floating thin=
g for saving life?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I decided to take that line for the present. I made a few vague affir=
matives. =E2=80=9CI want help,=E2=80=9D I said hoarsely. =E2=80=9CI want to=
 get some stuff up the beach=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94stuff I can=E2=80=99t very we=
ll leave about.=E2=80=9D I became aware of three other pleasant-looking you=
ng men with towels, blazers, and straw hats, coming down the sands towards =
me. Evidently the early bathing section of this Littlestone!</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHelp!=E2=80=9D said the young man; =E2=80=9Crather!=E2=80=9D=
 He became vaguely active. =E2=80=9CWhat particularly do you want done?=E2=
=80=9D He turned round and gesticulated. The three young men accelerated th=
eir pace. In a minute they were about me, plying me with questions I was in=
disposed to answer. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll tell all that later,=E2=80=9D I s=
aid. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m dead beat. I=E2=80=99m a rag.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CCome up to the hotel,=E2=80=9D said the foremost little man.=
 =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll look after that thing there.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I hesitated. =E2=80=9CI can=E2=80=99t,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CIn t=
hat sphere there=E2=80=99s two big bars of gold.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>They looked incredulously at one another, then at me with a new inqui=
ry. I went to the sphere, stooped, crept in, and presently they had the Sel=
enites=E2=80=99 crowbars and the broken chain before them. If I had not bee=
n so horribly fagged I could have laughed at them. It was like kittens roun=
d a beetle. They didn=E2=80=99t know what to do with the stuff. The fat lit=
tle man stooped and lifted the end of one of the bars, and then dropped it =
with a grunt. Then they all did.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s lead, or gold!=E2=80=9D said one.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COh, it=E2=80=99s <em>gold</em>!=E2=80=9D said another.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CGold, right enough,=E2=80=9D said the third.</p>
			<p>Then they all stared at me, and then they all stared at the ship lyin=
g at anchor.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI say!=E2=80=9D cried the little man. =E2=80=9CBut where did=
 you get that?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I was too tired to keep up a lie. =E2=80=9CI got it in the moon.=E2=
=80=9D</p>
			<p>I saw them stare at one another.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLook here!=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not going t=
o argue now. Help me carry these lumps of gold up to the hotel=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94I guess, with rests, two of you can manage one, and I=E2=80=99ll trai=
l this chain thing=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and I=E2=80=99ll tell you more when I=
=E2=80=99ve had some food.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd how about that thing?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt won=E2=80=99t hurt there,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CAnyho=
w=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94confound it!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it must stop there now. If=
 the tide comes up, it will float all right.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>And in a state of enormous wonderment, these young men most obedientl=
y hoisted my treasures on their shoulders, and with limbs that felt like le=
ad I headed a sort of procession towards that distant fragment of =E2=80=9C=
seafront.=E2=80=9D Halfway there we were reinforced by two awestricken litt=
le girls with spades, and later a lean little boy, with a penetrating sniff=
, appeared. He was, I remember, wheeling a bicycle, and he accompanied us a=
t a distance of about a hundred yards on our right flank, and then, I suppo=
se, gave us up as uninteresting, mounted his bicycle, and rode off over the=
 level sands in the direction of the sphere.</p>
			<p>I glanced back after him.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C<em>He</em> won=E2=80=99t touch it,=E2=80=9D said the stout =
young man reassuringly, and I was only too willing to be reassured.</p>
			<p>At first something of the grey of the morning was in my mind, but pre=
sently the sun disengaged itself from the level clouds of the horizon and l=
it the world, and turned the leaden sea to glittering waters. My spirits ro=
se. A sense of the vast importance of the things I had done and had yet to =
do came with the sunlight into my mind. I laughed aloud as the foremost man=
 staggered under my gold. When indeed I took my place in the world, how ama=
zed the world would be!</p>
			<p>If it had not been for my inordinate fatigue, the landlord of the Lit=
tlestone hotel would have been amusing, as he hesitated between my gold and=
 my respectable company on the one hand, and my filthy appearance on the ot=
her. But at last I found myself in a terrestrial bathroom once more with wa=
rm water to wash myself with, and a change of raiment, preposterously small=
 indeed, but anyhow clean, that the genial little man had lent me. He lent =
me a razor too, but I could not screw up my resolution to attack even the o=
utposts of the bristling beard that covered my face.</p>
			<p>I sat down to an English breakfast and ate with a sort of languid app=
etite=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94an appetite many weeks old, and very decrepit=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94and stirred myself to answer the questions of the four young me=
n. And I told them the truth.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell,=E2=80=9D said I, =E2=80=9Cas you press me=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94I got it in the moon.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe moon?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYes, the moon in the sky.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut how do you mean?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhat I say, confound it!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat you have just come from the moon?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CExactly! through space=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in that ball.=E2=80=
=9D And I took a delicious mouthful of egg. I made a private note that when=
 I went back to the moon I would take a box of eggs.</p>
			<p>I could see clearly that they did not believe one word of what I told=
 them, but evidently they considered me the most respectable liar they had =
ever met. They glanced at one another, and then concentrated the fire of th=
eir eyes on me. I fancy they expected a clue to me in the way I helped myse=
lf to salt. They seemed to find something significant in my peppering my eg=
g. These strangely shaped masses of gold they had staggered under held thei=
r minds. There the lumps lay in front of me, each worth thousands of pounds=
, and as impossible for anyone to steal as a house or a piece of land. As I=
 looked at their curious faces over my coffee-cup, I realised something of =
the enormous wilderness of explanations into which I should have to wander =
to render myself comprehensible again.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t <em>really</em> mean=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9D began the youngest young man, in the tone of one who speaks to an ob=
stinate child.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CJust pass me that toast-rack,=E2=80=9D I said, and shut him =
up completely.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut look here, I say,=E2=80=9D began one of the others. =E2=
=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re not going to believe that, you know.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAh, well,=E2=80=9D said I, and shrugged my shoulders.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe doesn=E2=80=99t want to tell us,=E2=80=9D said the younge=
st young man in a stage aside; and then, with an appearance of great sangfr=
oid, =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t mind if I take a cigarette?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I waved him a cordial assent, and proceeded with my breakfast. Two of=
 the others went and looked out of the farther window and talked inaudibly.=
 I was struck by a thought. =E2=80=9CThe tide,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cis=
 running out?=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>There was a pause, a doubt who should answer me. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99=
s near the ebb,=E2=80=9D said the fat little man.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWell, anyhow,=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9Cit won=E2=80=99t flo=
at far.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I decapitated my third egg, and began a little speech. =E2=80=9CLook =
here,=E2=80=9D I said. =E2=80=9CPlease don=E2=80=99t imagine I=E2=80=99m su=
rly or telling you uncivil lies, or anything of that sort. I=E2=80=99m forc=
ed almost, to be a little short and mysterious. I can quite understand this=
 is as queer as it can be, and that your imaginations must be going it. I c=
an assure you, you=E2=80=99re in at a memorable time. But I can=E2=80=99t m=
ake it clear to you now=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s impossible. I give yo=
u my word of honour I=E2=80=99ve come from the moon, and that=E2=80=99s all=
 I can tell you.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 All the same I=E2=80=
=99m tremendously obliged to you, you know, tremendously. I hope that my ma=
nner hasn=E2=80=99t in any way given you offence.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COh, not in the least!=E2=80=9D said the youngest young man a=
ffably. =E2=80=9CWe can quite understand,=E2=80=9D and staring hard at me a=
ll the time, he heeled his chair back until it very nearly upset, and recov=
ered with some exertion. =E2=80=9CNot a bit of it,=E2=80=9D said the fat yo=
ung man. =E2=80=9CDon=E2=80=99t you imagine <em>that</em>!=E2=80=9D and the=
y all got up and dispersed, and walked about and lit cigarettes, and genera=
lly tried to show they were perfectly amiable and disengaged, and entirely =
free from the slightest curiosity about me and the sphere. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=
=99m going to keep an eye on that ship out there all the same,=E2=80=9D I h=
eard one of them remarking in an undertone. If only they could have forced =
themselves to it, they would, I believe, even have gone out and left me. I =
went on with my third egg.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe weather,=E2=80=9D the fat little man remarked presently,=
 =E2=80=9Chas been immense, has it not? I don=E2=80=99t know <em>when</em> =
we have had such a summer.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CIt isn=E2=80=99t=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94?=E2=80=9D cried the littl=

			<p>All the others rushed to the window likewise. I sat staring at them.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>Suddenly I leapt up, knocked over my third egg, and rushed for the wi=
ndow also. I had just thought of something. =E2=80=9CNothing to be seen the=
re,=E2=80=9D cried the little man, rushing for the door.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s that boy!=E2=80=9D I cried, bawling in hoarse f=
ury; =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s that accursed boy!=E2=80=9D and turning about I =
pushed the waiter aside=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94he was just bringing me some more =
toast=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and rushed violently out of the room and down and ou=
t upon the queer little esplanade in front of the hotel.</p>
			<p>The sea, which had been smooth, was rough now with hurrying cat=E2=80=
=99s-paws, and all about where the sphere had been was tumbled water like t=
he wake of a ship. Above, a little puff of cloud whirled like dispersing sm=
oke, and the three or four people on the beach were staring up with interro=
gative faces towards the point of that unexpected report. And that was all!=
 Boots and waiter and the four young men in blazers came rushing out behind=
 me. Shouts came from windows and doors, and all sorts of worrying people c=
ame into sight=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94agape.</p>
			<p>For a time I stood there, too overwhelmed by this new development to =
think of the people.</p>
			<p>At first I was too stunned to see the thing as any definite disaster=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I was just stunned, as a man is by some accidental violen=
t blow. It is only afterwards he begins to appreciate his specific injury.&lt;=
/p&gt;
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CGood Lord!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I felt as though somebody was pouring funk out of a can down the back=
 of my neck. My legs became feeble. I had got the first intimation of what =
the disaster meant for me. There was that confounded boy=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94s=
ky high! I was utterly =E2=80=9Cleft.=E2=80=9D There was the gold in the co=
ffee-room=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94my only possession on earth. How would it all wo=
rk out? The general effect was of a gigantic unmanageable confusion.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI say,=E2=80=9D said the voice of the little man behind. =E2=
=80=9CI <em>say</em>, you know.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I wheeled about, and there were twenty or thirty people, a sort of ir=
regular investment of people, all bombarding me with dumb interrogation, wi=
th infinite doubt and suspicion. I felt the compulsion of their eyes intole=
rably. I groaned aloud.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI <em>can=E2=80=99t</em>!=E2=80=9D I shouted. =E2=80=9CI tel=
l you I can=E2=80=99t! I=E2=80=99m not equal to it! You must puzzle and=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94and be damned to you!=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>I gesticulated convulsively. He receded a step as though I had threat=
ened him. I made a bolt through them into the hotel. I charged back into th=
e coffee-room, rang the bell furiously. I gripped the waiter as he entered.=
 =E2=80=9CD=E2=80=99ye hear?=E2=80=9D I shouted. =E2=80=9CGet help and carr=
y these bars up to my room right away.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He failed to understand me, and I shouted and raved at him. A scared-=
looking little old man in a green apron appeared, and further two of the yo=
ung men in flannels. I made a dash at them and commandeered their services.=
 As soon as the gold was in my room I felt free to quarrel. =E2=80=9CNow ge=
t out,=E2=80=9D I shouted; =E2=80=9Call of you get out if you don=E2=80=99t=
 want to see a man go mad before your eyes!=E2=80=9D And I helped the waite=
r by the shoulder as he hesitated in the doorway. And then, as soon as I ha=
d the door locked on them all, I tore off the little man=E2=80=99s clothes =
again, shied them right and left, and got into bed forthwith. And there I l=
ay swearing and panting and cooling for a very long time.</p>
			<p>At last I was calm enough to get out of bed and ring up the round-eye=
d waiter for a flannel nightshirt, a soda and whisky, and some good cigars.=
 And these things being procured me, after an exasperating delay that drove=
 me several times to the bell, I locked the door again and proceeded very d=
eliberately to look the entire situation in the face.</p>
			<p>The net result of the great experiment presented itself as an absolut=
e failure. It was a rout, and I was the sole survivor. It was an absolute c=
ollapse, and this was the final disaster. There was nothing for it but to s=
ave myself, and as much as I could in the way of prospects from our debacle=
. At one fatal crowning blow all my vague resolutions of return and recover=
y had vanished. My intention of going back to the moon, of getting a sphere=
ful of gold, and afterwards of having a fragment of Cavorite analysed and s=
o recovering the great secret=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94perhaps, finally, even of re=
covering Cavor=E2=80=99s body=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94all these ideas vanished alt=
ogether.</p>
			<p>I was the sole survivor, and that was all.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>I think that going to bed was one of the luckiest ideas I have ever h=
ad in an emergency. I really believe I should either have got loose-headed =
or done some fatal, indiscreet thing. But there, locked in and secure from =
all interruption, I could think out the position in all its bearings and ma=
ke my arrangements at leisure.</p>
			<p>Of course it was quite clear to me what had happened to the boy. He h=
ad crawled into the sphere, meddled with the studs, shut the Cavorite windo=
ws, and gone up. It was highly improbable he had screwed in the manhole sto=
pper, and, even if he had, the chances were a thousand to one against his g=
etting back. It was fairly evident that he would gravitate with my bales to=
 somewhere near the middle of the sphere and remain there, and so cease to =
be a legitimate terrestrial interest, however remarkable he might seem to t=
he inhabitants of some remote quarter of space. I very speedily convinced m=
yself on that point. And as for any responsibility I might have in the matt=
er, the more I reflected upon that, the clearer it became that if only I ke=
pt quiet about things, I need not trouble myself about that. If I was faced=
 by sorrowing parents demanding their lost boy, I had merely to demand my l=
ost sphere=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94or ask them what they meant. At first I had had=
 a vision of weeping parents and guardians, and all sorts of complications;=
 but now I saw that I simply had to keep my mouth shut, and nothing in that=
 way could arise. And, indeed, the more I lay and smoked and thought, the m=
ore evident became the wisdom of impenetrability.</p>
			<p>It is within the right of every British citizen, provided he does not=
 commit damage nor indecorum, to appear suddenly wherever he pleases, and a=
s ragged and filthy as he pleases, and with whatever amount of virgin gold =
he sees fit to encumber himself, and no one has any right at all to hinder =
and detain him in this procedure. I formulated that at last to myself, and =
repeated it over as a sort of private Magna Carta of my liberty.</p>
			<p>Once I had put that issue on one side, I could take up and consider i=
n an equable manner certain considerations I had scarcely dared to think of=
 before, namely, those arising out of the circumstances of my bankruptcy. B=
ut now, looking at this matter calmly and at leisure, I could see that if o=
nly I suppressed my identity by a temporary assumption of some less well-kn=
own name, and if I retained the two months=E2=80=99 beard that had grown up=
on me, the risks of any annoyance from the spiteful creditor to whom I have=
 already alluded became very small indeed. From that to a definite course o=
f rational worldly action was plain sailing. It was all amazingly petty, no=
 doubt, but what was there remaining for me to do?</p>
			<p>Whatever I did I was resolved that I would keep myself level and righ=
t side up.</p>
			<p>I ordered up writing materials, and addressed a letter to the New Rom=
ney Bank=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the nearest, the waiter informed me=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94telling the manager I wished to open an account with him, and request=
ing him to send two trustworthy persons properly authenticated in a cab wit=
h a good horse to fetch some hundredweight of gold with which I happened to=
 be encumbered. I signed the letter =E2=80=9CBlake,=E2=80=9D which seemed t=
o me to be a thoroughly respectable sort of name. This done, I got a Folkes=
tone Blue Book, picked out an outfitter, and asked him to send a cutter to =
measure me for a drab tweed suit, ordering at the same time a valise, dress=
ing bag, brown boots, shirts, hats (to fit), and so forth; and from a watch=
maker I also ordered a watch. And these letters being despatched, I had up =
as good a lunch as the hotel could give, and then lay smoking a cigar, as c=
alm and ordinary as possible, until in accordance with my instructions two =
duly authenticated clerks came from the bank and weighed and took away my g=
old. After which I pulled the clothes over my ears in order to drown any kn=
ocking, and went very comfortably to sleep.</p>
			<p>I went to sleep. No doubt it was a prosaic thing for the first man ba=
ck from the moon to do, and I can imagine that the young and imaginative re=
ader will find my behaviour disappointing. But I was horribly fatigued and =
bothered, and, confound it! what else was there to do? There certainly was =
not the remotest chance of my being believed, if I had told my story then, =
and it would certainly have subjected me to intolerable annoyances. I went =
to sleep. When at last I woke up again I was ready to face the world, as I =
have always been accustomed to face it since I came to years of discretion.=
 And so I got away to Italy, and there it is I am writing this story. If th=
e world will not have it as fact, then the world may take it as fiction. It=
 is no concern of mine.</p>
			<p>And now that the account is finished, I am amazed to think how comple=
tely this adventure is gone and done with. Everybody believes that Cavor wa=
s a not very brilliant scientific experimenter who blew up his house and hi=
mself at Lympne, and they explain the bang that followed my arrival at Litt=
lestone by a reference to the experiments with explosives that are going on=
 continually at the government establishment of Lydd, two miles away. I mus=
t confess that hitherto I have not acknowledged my share in the disappearan=
ce of Master Tommy Simmons, which was that little boy=E2=80=99s name. That,=
 perhaps, may prove a difficult item of corroboration to explain away. They=
 account for my appearance in rags with two bars of indisputable gold upon =
the Littlestone beach in various ingenious ways=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it doesn=
=E2=80=99t worry me what they think of me. They say I have strung all these=
 things together to avoid being questioned too closely as to the source of =
my wealth. I would like to see the man who could invent a story that would =
hold together like this one. Well, they must take it as fiction=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94there it is.</p>
			<p>I have told my story=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and now I suppose I have to tak=
e up the worries of this terrestrial life again. Even if one has been to th=
e moon, one has still to earn a living. So I am working here at Amalfi, on =
the scenario of that play I sketched before Cavor came walking into my worl=
d, and I am trying to piece my life together as it was before ever I saw hi=
m. I must confess that I find it hard to keep my mind on the play when the =
moonshine comes into my room. It is full moon here, and last night I was ou=
t on the pergola for hours, staring away at that shining blankness that hid=
es so much. Imagine it! tables and chairs, and trestles and bars of gold! C=
onfound it!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94if only one could hit on that Cavorite again! =
But a thing like that doesn=E2=80=99t come twice in a life. Here I am, a li=
ttle better off than I was at Lympne, and that is all. And Cavor has commit=
ted suicide in a more elaborate way than any human being ever did before. S=
o the story closes as finally and completely as a dream. It fits in so litt=
le with all the other things of life, so much of it is so utterly remote fr=
om all human experience, the leaping, the eating, the breathing, and these =
weightless times, that indeed there are moments when, in spite of my moon g=
old, I do more than half believe myself that the whole thing was a dream.=

			</hgroup>
			<p>When I had finished my account of my return to the earth at Littlesto=
ne I wrote, =E2=80=9CThe End,=E2=80=9D made a flourish, and threw my pen as=
ide, fully believing that the whole story of the First Men in the Moon was =
done. Not only had I done this, but I had placed my manuscript in the hands=
 of a literary agent, had permitted it to be sold, had seen the greater por=
tion of it appear in the <i epub:type="3D&quot;se:name.publication.magazine&quot;">Stra=
nd Magazine</i>, and was setting to work again upon the scenario of the pla=
y I had commenced at Lympne before I realised that the end was not yet. And=
 then, following me from Amalfi to Algiers, there reached me (it is now abo=
ut six months ago) one of the most astounding communications I have ever be=
en fated to receive. Briefly, it informed me that <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:=" name-title"="">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has b=
een experimenting with certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by <abb= r="" epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.=C2=A0Tesla in America, in the h=
ope of discovering some method of communication with Mars, was receiving da=
y by day a curiously fragmentary message in English, which was indisputably=
 emanating from <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Cavor =
in the moon.</abb=></p>
			<p>At first I thought the thing was an elaborate practical joke by someo=
ne who had seen the manuscript of my narrative. I answered <abbr epub:type="=3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Wendigee jestingly, but he replied in=
 a manner that put such suspicion altogether aside, and in a state of incon=
ceivable excitement I hurried from Algiers to the little observatory upon t=
he <abbr>St.</abbr>=C2=A0Gothard in which he was working. In the presence o=
f his record and his appliances=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and above all of the messa=
ges from Cavor that were coming to hand=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94my lingering doubt=
s vanished. I decided at once to accept a proposal he made me to remain wit=
h him, assisting him to take down the record from day to day, and endeavour=
ing with him to send a message back to the moon. Cavor, we learnt, was not =
only alive but free, in the midst of an almost inconceivable community of t=
hese ant-like beings, these ant-men, in the blue darkness of the lunar cave=
s. He was lamed, it seemed, but otherwise in quite good health=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94in better health, he distinctly said, than he usually enjoyed on eart=
h. He had had a fever, but it had left no bad effects. But curiously enough=
 he seemed to be labouring under a conviction that I was either dead in the=
 moon crater or lost in the deep of space.</p>
			<p>His message began to be received by <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-tit=" le"="">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Wendigee when that gentleman was engaged in quite a dif=
ferent investigation. The reader will no doubt recall the little excitement=
 that began the century, arising out of an announcement by <abbr epub:type="=3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Nikola Tesla, the American electrical=
 celebrity, that he had received a message from Mars. His announcement rene=
wed attention to a fact that had long been familiar to scientific people, n=
amely: that from some unknown source in space, waves of electromagnetic dis=
turbance, entirely similar to those used by Signor Marconi for his wireless=
 telegraphy, are constantly reaching the earth. Besides <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;=" z3998:name-title"="">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Tesla quite a number of other observers h=
ave been engaged in perfecting apparatus for receiving and recording these =
vibrations, though few would go so far as to consider them actual messages =
from some extraterrestrial sender. Among that few, however, we must certain=
ly count <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Wendigee. Eve=
r since 1898 he had devoted himself almost entirely to this subject, and be=
ing a man of ample means he had erected an observatory on the flanks of Mon=
te Rosa, in a position singularly adapted in every way for such observation=
s.</p>
			<p>My scientific attainments, I must admit, are not great, but so far as=
 they enable me to judge, <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=
=C2=A0Wendigee=E2=80=99s contrivances for detecting and recording any distu=
rbances in the electromagnetic conditions of space are singularly original =
and ingenious. And by a happy combination of circumstances they were set up=
 and in operation about two months before Cavor made his first attempt to c=
all up the earth. Consequently we have fragments of his communication even =
from the beginning. Unhappily, they are only fragments, and the most moment=
ous of all the things that he had to tell humanity=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the ins=
tructions, that is, for the making of Cavorite, if, indeed, he ever transmi=
tted them=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94have throbbed themselves away unrecorded into sp=
ace. We never succeeded in getting a response back to Cavor. He was unable =
to tell, therefore, what we had received or what we had missed; nor, indeed=
, did he certainly know that anyone on earth was really aware of his effort=
s to reach us. And the persistence he displayed in sending eighteen long de=
scriptions of lunar affairs=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94as they would be if we had the=
m complete=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94shows how much his mind must have turned back t=
owards his native planet since he left it two years ago.</p>
			<p>You can imagine how amazed <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.<!--
abbr-->=C2=A0Wendigee must have been when he discovered his record of electro=
magnetic disturbances interlaced by Cavor=E2=80=99s straightforward English=
. <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Wendigee knew nothin=
g of our wild journey moonward, and suddenly=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94this English =
out of the void!</abbr></p>
			<p>It is well the reader should understand the conditions under which it=
 would seem these messages were sent. Somewhere within the moon Cavor certa=
inly had access for a time to a considerable amount of electrical apparatus=
, and it would seem he rigged up=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94perhaps furtively=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94a transmitting arrangement of the Marconi type. This he was abl=
e to operate at irregular intervals: sometimes for only half-an-hour or so,=
 sometimes for three or four hours at a stretch. At these times he transmit=
ted his earthward message, regardless of the fact that the relative positio=
n of the moon and points upon the earth=E2=80=99s surface is constantly alt=
ering. As a consequence of this and of the necessary imperfections of our r=
ecording instruments his communication comes and goes in our records in an =
extremely fitful manner; it becomes blurred; it =E2=80=9Cfades out=E2=80=9D=
 in a mysterious and altogether exasperating way. And added to this is the =
fact that he was not an expert operator; he had partly forgotten, or never =
completely mastered, the code in general use, and as he became fatigued he =
dropped words and misspelt in a curious manner.</p>
			<p>Altogether we have probably lost quite half of the communications he =
made, and much we have is damaged, broken, and partly effaced. In the abstr=
act that follows the reader must be prepared therefore for a considerable a=
mount of break, hiatus, and change of topic. <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-=" title"="">Mr.</abbr>=C2=A0Wendigee and I are collaborating in a complete and a=
nnotated edition of the Cavor record, which we hope to publish, together wi=
th a detailed account of the instruments employed, beginning with the first=
 volume in January next. That will be the full and scientific report, of wh=
ich this is only the popular first transcript. But here we give at least su=
fficient to complete the story I have told, and to give the broad outlines =
of the state of that other world so near, so akin, and yet so dissimilar to=
 our own.</p>

			</hgroup>
			<p>The two earlier messages of <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.&lt;=
/abbr&gt;=C2=A0Cavor may very well be reserved for that larger volume. They si=
mply tell, with greater brevity and with a difference in several details th=
at is interesting, but not of any vital importance, the bare facts of the m=
aking of the sphere and our departure from the world. Throughout, Cavor spe=
aks of me as a man who is dead, but with a curious change of temper as he a=
pproaches our landing on the moon. =E2=80=9CPoor Bedford,=E2=80=9D he says =
of me, and =E2=80=9Cthis poor young man=E2=80=9D; and he blames himself for=
 inducing a young man, =E2=80=9Cby no means well equipped for such adventur=
es,=E2=80=9D to leave a planet =E2=80=9Con which he was indisputably fitted=
 to succeed=E2=80=9D on so precarious a mission. I think he underrates the =
part my energy and practical capacity played in bringing about the realisat=
ion of his theoretical sphere. =E2=80=9CWe arrived,=E2=80=9D he says, with =
no more account of our passage through space than if we had made a journey =
of common occurrence in a railway train.</abbr></p>
			<p>And then he becomes increasingly unfair to me. Unfair, indeed, to an =
extent I should not have expected in a man trained in the search for truth.=
 Looking back over my previously written account of these things, I must in=
sist that I have been altogether juster to Cavor than he has been to me. I =
have extenuated little and suppressed nothing. But his account is:=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=94</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt speedily became apparent that the entire strangeness of o=
ur circumstances and surroundings=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94great loss of weight, at=
tenuated but highly oxygenated air, consequent exaggeration of the results =
of muscular effort, rapid development of weird plants from obscure spores, =
lurid sky=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94was exciting my companion unduly. On the moon hi=
s character seemed to deteriorate. He became impulsive, rash, and quarrelso=
me. In a little while his folly in devouring some gigantic vesicles and his=
 consequent intoxication led to our capture by the Selenites=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94before we had had the slightest opportunity of properly observing their =
ways.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>(He says, you observe, nothing of his own concession to these same =
=E2=80=9Cvesicles.=E2=80=9D)</p>
			<p>And he goes on from that point to say that =E2=80=9CWe came to a diff=
icult passage with them, and Bedford mistaking certain gestures of theirs=
=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94pretty gestures they were!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=
=80=9Cgave way to a panic violence. He ran amuck, killed three, and perforc=
e I had to flee with him after the outrage. Subsequently we fought with a n=
umber who endeavoured to bar our way, and slew seven or eight more. It says=
 much for the tolerance of these beings that on my recapture I was not inst=
antly slain. We made our way to the exterior and separated in the crater of=
 our arrival, to increase our chances of recovering our sphere. But present=
ly I came upon a body of Selenites, led by two who were curiously different=
, even in form, from any of those we had seen hitherto, with larger heads a=
nd smaller bodies, and much more elaborately wrapped about. And after evadi=
ng them for some time I fell into a crevasse, cut my head rather badly and =
displaced my patella, and, finding crawling very painful, decided to surren=
der=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94if they would still permit me to do so. This they did,=
 and, perceiving my helpless condition, carried me with them again into the=
 moon. And of Bedford I have heard or seen nothing more, nor, so far as I c=
an gather, has any Selenite. Either the night overtook him in the crater, o=
r else, which is more probable, he found the sphere, and, desiring to steal=
 a march upon me, made off with it=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94only, I fear, to find i=
t uncontrollable, and to meet a more lingering fate in outer space.=E2=80=
=9D</p>
			<p>And with that Cavor dismisses me and goes on to more interesting topi=
cs. I dislike the idea of seeming to use my position as his editor to defle=
ct his story in my own interest, but I am obliged to protest here against t=
he turn he gives these occurrences. He says nothing about that gasping mess=
age on the bloodstained paper in which he told, or attempted to tell, a ver=
y different story. The dignified self-surrender is an altogether new view o=
f the affair that has come to him, I must insist, since he began to feel se=
cure among the lunar people; and as for the =E2=80=9Cstealing a march=E2=80=
=9D conception, I am quite willing to let the reader decide between us on w=
hat he has before him. I know I am not a model man=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I have =
made no pretence to be. But am I <em>that</em>?</p>
			<p>However, that is the sum of my wrongs. From this point I can edit Cav=
or with an untroubled mind, for he mentions me no more.</p>
			<p>It would seem the Selenites who had come upon him carried him to some=
 point in the interior down =E2=80=9Ca great shaft=E2=80=9D by means of wha=
t he describes as =E2=80=9Ca sort of balloon.=E2=80=9D We gather from the r=
ather confused passage in which he describes this, and from a number of cha=
nce allusions and hints in other and subsequent messages, that this =E2=80=
=9Cgreat shaft=E2=80=9D is one of an enormous system of artificial shafts t=
hat run, each from what is called a lunar =E2=80=9Ccrater,=E2=80=9D downwar=
ds for very nearly a hundred miles towards the central portion of our satel=
lite. These shafts communicate by transverse tunnels, they throw out abysma=
l caverns and expand into great globular places; the whole of the moon=E2=
=80=99s substance for a hundred miles inward, indeed, is a mere sponge of r=
ock. =E2=80=9CPartly,=E2=80=9D says Cavor, =E2=80=9Cthis sponginess is natu=
ral, but very largely it is due to the enormous industry of the Selenites i=
n the past. The enormous circular mounds of the excavated rock and earth it=
 is that form these great circles about the tunnels known to earthly astron=
omers (misled by a false analogy) as volcanoes.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>It was down this shaft they took him, in this =E2=80=9Csort of balloo=
n=E2=80=9D he speaks of, at first into an inky blackness and then into a re=
gion of continually increasing phosphorescence. Cavor=E2=80=99s despatches =
show him to be curiously regardless of detail for a scientific man, but we =
gather that this light was due to the streams and cascades of water=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cno doubt containing some phosphorescent organism=E2=80=
=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94that flowed ever more abundantly downward towards the =
Central Sea. And as he descended, he says, =E2=80=9CThe Selenites also beca=
me luminous.=E2=80=9D And at last far below him he saw, as it were, a lake =
of heatless fire, the waters of the Central Sea, glowing and eddying in str=
ange perturbation, =E2=80=9Clike luminous blue milk that is just on the boi=
l.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThis Lunar Sea,=E2=80=9D says Cavor, in a later passage, =E2=
=80=9Cis not a stagnant ocean; a solar tide sends it in a perpetual flow ar=
ound the lunar axis, and strange storms and boilings and rushings of its wa=
ters occur, and at times cold winds and thunderings that ascend out of it i=
nto the busy ways of the great anthill above. It is only when the water is =
in motion that it gives out light; in its rare seasons of calm it is black.=
 Commonly, when one sees it, its waters rise and fall in an oily swell, and=
 flakes and big rafts of shining, bubbly foam drift with the sluggish, fain=
tly glowing current. The Selenites navigate its cavernous straits and lagoo=
ns in little shallow boats of a canoe-like shape; and even before my journe=
y to the galleries about the Grand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon, I was =
permitted to make a brief excursion on its waters.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe caverns and passages are naturally very tortuous. A larg=
e proportion of these ways are known only to expert pilots among the fisher=
men, and not infrequently Selenites are lost forever in their labyrinths. I=
n their remoter recesses, I am told, strange creatures lurk, some of them t=
errible and dangerous creatures that all the science of the moon has been u=
nable to exterminate. There is particularly the Rapha, an inextricable mass=
 of clutching tentacles that one hacks to pieces only to multiply; and the =
Tzee, a darting creature that is never seen, so subtly and suddenly does it=
 slay.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He gives us a gleam of description.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI was reminded on this excursion of what I have read of the =
Mammoth Caves; if only I had had a yellow flambeau instead of the pervading=
 blue light, and a solid-looking boatman with an oar instead of a scuttle-f=
aced Selenite working an engine at the back of the canoe, I could have imag=
ined I had suddenly got back to earth. The rocks about us were very various=
, sometimes black, sometimes pale blue and veined, and once they flashed an=
d glittered as though we had come into a mine of sapphires. And below one s=
aw the ghostly phosphorescent fishes flash and vanish in the hardly less ph=
osphorescent deep. Then, presently, a long ultramarine vista down the turgi=
d stream of one of the channels of traffic, and a landing-stage, and then, =
perhaps, a glimpse up the enormous crowded shaft of one of the vertical way=
s.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn one great place heavy with glistening stalactites a numbe=
r of boats were fishing. We went alongside one of these and watched the lon=
g-armed fishing Selenites winding in a net. They were little, hunchbacked i=
nsects, with very strong arms, short, bandy legs, and crinkled face-masks. =
As they pulled at it that net seemed the heaviest thing I had come upon in =
the moon; it was loaded with weights=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94no doubt of gold=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94and it took a long time to draw, for in those waters the lar=
ger and more edible fish lurk deep. The fish in the net came up like a blue=
 moonrise=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a blaze of darting, tossing blue.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAmong their catch was a many-tentaculate, evil-eyed black th=
ing, ferociously active, whose appearance they greeted with shrieks and twi=
tters, and which with quick, nervous movements they hacked to pieces by mea=
ns of little hatchets. All its dissevered limbs continued to lash and writh=
e in a vicious manner. Afterwards, when fever had hold of me, I dreamt agai=
n and again of that bitter, furious creature rising so vigorous and active =
out of the unknown sea. It was the most active and malignant thing of all t=
he living creatures I have yet seen in this world inside the moon.=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<hr>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe surface of this sea must be very nearly two hundred mile=
s (if not more) below the level of the moon=E2=80=99s exterior; all the cit=
ies of the moon lie, I learnt, immediately above this Central Sea, in such =
cavernous spaces and artificial galleries as I have described, and they com=
municate with the exterior by enormous vertical shafts which open invariabl=
y in what are called by earthly astronomers the =E2=80=98craters=E2=80=99 o=
f the moon. The lid covering one such aperture I had already seen during th=
e wanderings that had preceded my capture.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CUpon the condition of the less central portion of the moon I=
 have not yet arrived at very precise knowledge. There is an enormous syste=
m of caverns in which the mooncalves shelter during the night; and there ar=
e abattoirs and the like=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94in one of these it was that I and=
 Bedford fought with the Selenite butchers=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and I have sinc=
e seen balloons laden with meat descending out of the upper dark. I have as=
 yet scarcely learnt as much of these things as a Zulu in London would lear=
n about the British corn supplies in the same time. It is clear, however, t=
hat these vertical shafts and the vegetation of the surface must play an es=
sential role in ventilating and keeping fresh the atmosphere of the moon. A=
t one time, and particularly on my first emergence from my prison, there wa=
s certainly a cold wind blowing <em>down</em> the shaft, and later there wa=
s a kind of sirocco upward that corresponded with my fever. For at the end =
of about three weeks I fell ill of an indefinable sort of fever, and in spi=
te of sleep and the quinine tabloids that very fortunately I had brought in=
 my pocket, I remained ill and fretting miserably, almost to the time when =
I was taken into the presence of the Grand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon=
.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI will not dilate on the wretchedness of my condition,=E2=80=
=9D he remarks, =E2=80=9Cduring those days of ill-health.=E2=80=9D And he g=
oes on with great amplitude with details I omit here. =E2=80=9CMy temperatu=
re,=E2=80=9D he concludes, =E2=80=9Ckept abnormally high for a long time, a=
nd I lost all desire for food. I had stagnant waking intervals, and sleep t=
ormented by dreams, and at one phase I was, I remember, so weak as to be ea=
rth-sick and almost hysterical. I longed almost intolerably for colour to b=
reak the everlasting blue.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He reverts again presently to the topic of this sponge caught lunar a=
tmosphere. I am told by astronomers and physicists that all he tells is in =
absolute accordance with what was already known of the moon=E2=80=99s condi=
tion. Had earthly astronomers had the courage and imagination to push home =
a bold induction, says <abbr epub:type="3D&quot;z3998:name-title&quot;">Mr.</abbr>=C2=
=A0Wendigee, they might have foretold almost everything that Cavor has to s=
ay of the general structure of the moon. They know now pretty certainly tha=
t moon and earth are not so much satellite and primary as smaller and great=
er sisters, made out of one mass, and consequently made of the same materia=
l. And since the density of the moon is only three-fifths that of the earth=
, there can be nothing for it but that she is hollowed out by a great syste=
m of caverns. There was no necessity, said Sir Jabez Flap, <abbr epub:type="=3D&quot;z3998:initialism&quot;">F.R.S.</abbr>, that most entertaining exponent of the=
 facetious side of the stars, that we should ever have gone to the moon to =
find out such easy inferences, and points the pun with an allusion to Gruy=
=C3=A8re, but he certainly might have announced his knowledge of the hollow=
ness of the moon before. And if the moon is hollow, then the apparent absen=
ce of air and water is, of course, quite easily explained. The sea lies wit=
hin at the bottom of the caverns, and the air travels through the great spo=
nge of galleries, in accordance with simple physical laws. The caverns of t=
he moon, on the whole, are very windy places. As the sunlight comes round t=
he moon the air in the outer galleries on that side is heated, its pressure=
 increases, some flows out on the exterior and mingles with the evaporating=
 air of the craters (where the plants remove its carbonic acid), while the =
greater portion flows round through the galleries to replace the shrinking =
air of the cooling side that the sunlight has left. There is, therefore, a =
constant eastward breeze in the air of the outer galleries, and an up-flow =
during the lunar day up the shafts, complicated, of course, very greatly by=
 the varying shape of the galleries, and the ingenious contrivances of the =
Selenite mind.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>

				<p epub:type="3D&quot;title&quot;">The Natural History of the Selenites</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>The messages of Cavor from the sixth up to the sixteenth are for the =
most part so much broken, and they abound so in repetitions, that they scar=
cely form a consecutive narrative. They will be given in full, of course, i=
n the scientific report, but here it will be far more convenient to continu=
e simply to abstract and quote as in the former chapter. We have subjected =
every word to a keen critical scrutiny, and my own brief memories and impre=
ssions of lunar things have been of inestimable help in interpreting what w=
ould otherwise have been impenetrably dark. And, naturally, as living being=
s our interest centres far more upon the strange community of lunar insects=
 in which he was living, it would seem, as an honoured guest than upon the =
mere physical condition of their world.</p>
			<p>I have already made it clear, I think, that the Selenites I saw resem=
bled man in maintaining the erect attitude, and in having four limbs, and I=
 have compared the general appearance of their heads and the jointing of th=
eir limbs to that of insects. I have mentioned, too, the peculiar consequen=
ce of the smaller gravitation of the moon on their fragile slightness. Cavo=
r confirms me upon all these points. He calls them =E2=80=9Canimals,=E2=80=
=9D though of course they fall under no division of the classification of e=
arthly creatures, and he points out =E2=80=9Cthe insect type of anatomy had=
, fortunately for men, never exceeded a relatively very small size on earth=
.=E2=80=9D The largest terrestrial insects, living or extinct, do not, as a=
 matter of fact, measure 6=C2=A0<abbr>in.</abbr> in length; =E2=80=9Cbut he=
re, against the lesser gravitation of the moon, a creature certainly as muc=
h an insect as vertebrate seems to have been able to attain to human and ul=
trahuman dimensions.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>He does not mention the ant, but throughout his allusions the ant is =
continually being brought before my mind, in its sleepless activity, in its=
 intelligence and social organisation, in its structure, and more particula=
rly in the fact that it displays, in addition to the two forms, the male an=
d the female form, that almost all other animals possess, a number of other=
 sexless creatures, workers, soldiers, and the like, differing from one ano=
ther in structure, character, power, and use, and yet all members of the sa=
me species. For these Selenites, also, have a great variety of forms. Of co=
urse they are not only colossally greater in size than ants, but also, in C=
avor=E2=80=99s opinion at least, in intelligence, morality, and social wisd=
om are they colossally greater than men. And instead of the four or five di=
fferent forms of ant that are found, there are almost innumerably different=
 forms of Selenite. I have endeavoured to indicate the very considerable di=
fference observable in such Selenites of the outer crust as I happened to e=
ncounter; the differences in size and proportions were certainly as wide as=
 the differences between the most widely separated races of men. But such d=
ifferences as I saw fade absolutely to nothing in comparison with the huge =
distinctions of which Cavor tells. It would seem the exterior Selenites I s=
aw were, indeed, mostly engaged in kindred occupations=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94moo=
ncalf herds, butchers, fleshers, and the like. But within the moon, practic=
ally unsuspected by me, there are, it seems, a number of other sorts of Sel=
enite, differing in size, differing in the relative size of part to part, d=
iffering in power and appearance, and yet not different species of creature=
s, but only different forms of one species, and retaining through all their=
 variations a certain common likeness that marks their specific unity. The =
moon is, indeed, a sort of vast anthill, only, instead of there being only =
four or five sorts of ant, there are many hundred different sorts of Seleni=
te, and almost every gradation between one sort and another.</p>
			<p>It would seem the discovery came upon Cavor very speedily. I infer ra=
ther than learn from his narrative that he was captured by the mooncalf her=
ds under the direction of those other Selenites who =E2=80=9Chave larger br=
ain cases (heads?) and very much shorter legs.=E2=80=9D Finding he would no=
t walk even under the goad, they carried him into darkness, crossed a narro=
w, plank-like bridge that may have been the identical bridge I had refused,=
 and put him down in something that must have seemed at first to be some so=
rt of lift. This was the balloon=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94it had certainly been abs=
olutely invisible to us in the darkness=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and what had seeme=
d to me a mere plank-walking into the void was really, no doubt, the passag=
e of the gangway. In this he descended towards constantly more luminous cav=
erns of the moon. At first they descended in silence=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94save =
for the twitterings of the Selenites=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and then into a stir =
of windy movement. In a little while the profound blackness had made his ey=
es so sensitive that he began to see more and more of the things about him,=
 and at last the vague took shape.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CConceive an enormous cylindrical space,=E2=80=9D says Cavor =
in his seventh message, =E2=80=9Ca quarter of a mile across, perhaps; very =
dimly lit at first and then brighter, with big platforms twisting down its =
sides in a spiral that vanishes at last below in a blue profundity; and lit=
 even more brightly=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94one could not tell how or why. Think o=
f the well of the very largest spiral staircase or lift-shaft that you have=
 ever looked down, and magnify that by a hundred. Imagine it at twilight se=
en through blue glass. Imagine yourself looking down that; only imagine als=
o that you feel extraordinarily light, and have got rid of any giddy feelin=
g you might have on earth, and you will have the first conditions of my imp=
ression. Round this enormous shaft imagine a broad gallery running in a muc=
h steeper spiral than would be credible on earth, and forming a steep road =
protected from the gulf only by a little parapet that vanishes at last in p=
erspective a couple of miles below.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CLooking up, I saw the very fellow of the downward vision; it=
 had, of course, the effect of looking into a very steep cone. A wind was b=
lowing down the shaft, and far above I fancy I heard, growing fainter and f=
ainter, the bellowing of the mooncalves that were being driven down again f=
rom their evening pasturage on the exterior. And up and down the spiral gal=
leries were scattered numerous moon people, pallid, faintly self-luminous b=
eings, regarding our appearance or busied on unknown errands.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CEither I fancied it or a flake of snow came drifting down on=
 the icy breeze. And then, falling like a snowflake, a little figure, a lit=
tle man-insect clinging to a parachute, drove down very swiftly towards the=
 central places of the moon.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe big-headed Selenite sitting beside me, seeing me move my=
 head with the gesture of one who saw, pointed with his trunk-like =E2=80=
=98hand=E2=80=99 and indicated a sort of jetty coming into sight very far b=
elow: a little landing-stage, as it were, hanging into the void. As it swep=
t up towards us our pace diminished very rapidly, and in a few moments, as =
it seemed, we were abreast of it and at rest. A mooring-rope was flung and =
grasped, and I found myself pulled down to a level with a great crowd of Se=
lenites, who jostled to see me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt was an incredible crowd. Suddenly and violently there was=
 forced upon my attention the vast amount of difference there is amongst th=
ese beings of the moon.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIndeed, there seemed not two alike in all that jostling mult=
itude. They differed in shape, they differed in size, they rang all the hor=
rible changes on the theme of Selenite form! Some bulged and overhung, some=
 ran about among the feet of their fellows. All of them had a grotesque and=
 disquieting suggestion of an insect that has somehow contrived to mock hum=
anity; but all seemed to present an incredible exaggeration of some particu=
lar feature: one had a vast right forelimb, an enormous antennal arm, as it=
 were; one seemed all leg, poised, as it were, on stilts; another protruded=
 the edge of his face mask into a nose-like organ that made him startlingly=
 human until one saw his expressionless gaping mouth. The strange and (exce=
pt for the want of mandibles and palps) most insect-like head of the moonca=
lf-minders underwent, indeed, the most incredible transformations: here it =
was broad and low, here high and narrow; here its leathery brow was drawn o=
ut into horns and strange features; here it was whiskered and divided, and =
there with a grotesquely human profile. One distortion was particularly con=
spicuous. There were several brain cases distended like bladders to a huge =
size, with the face mask reduced to quite small proportions. There were sev=
eral amazing forms, with heads reduced to microscopic proportions and blobb=
y bodies; and fantastic, flimsy things that existed, it would seem, only as=
 a basis for vast, trumpet-like protrusions of the lower part of the mask. =
And oddest of all, as it seemed to me for the moment, two or three of these=
 weird inhabitants of a subterranean world, a world sheltered by innumerabl=
e miles of rock from sun or rain, <em>carried umbrellas</em> in their tenta=
culate hands!=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94real terrestrial-looking umbrellas! And then=
 I thought of the parachutist I had watched descend.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThese moon people behaved exactly as a human crowd might hav=
e done in similar circumstances: they jostled and thrust one another, they =
shoved one another aside, they even clambered upon one another to get a gli=
mpse of me. Every moment they increased in numbers, and pressed more urgent=
ly upon the discs of my ushers=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94Cavor does not exp=
lain what he means by this=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cevery moment fresh sha=
pes emerged from the shadows and forced themselves upon my astounded attent=
ion. And presently I was signed and helped into a sort of litter, and lifte=
d up on the shoulders of strong-armed bearers, and so borne through the twi=
light over this seething multitude towards the apartments that were provide=
d for me in the moon. All about me were eyes, faces, masks, a leathery nois=
e like the rustling of beetle wings, and a great bleating and cricket-like =
twittering of Selenite voices.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=E2=80=9D=
</p>
			<hr>
			<p>We gather he was taken to a =E2=80=9Chexagonal apartment,=E2=80=9D an=
d there for a space he was confined. Afterwards he was given a much more co=
nsiderable liberty; indeed, almost as much freedom as one has in a civilise=
d town on earth. And it would appear that the mysterious being who is the r=
uler and master of the moon appointed two Selenites =E2=80=9Cwith large hea=
ds=E2=80=9D to guard and study him, and to establish whatever mental commun=
ications were possible with him. And, amazing and incredible as it may seem=
, these two creatures, these fantastic men-insects, these beings of another=
 world, were presently communicating with Cavor by means of terrestrial spe=
ech.</p>
			<p>Cavor speaks of them as Phi-oo and Tsi-puff. Phi-oo, he says, was abo=
ut 5=C2=A0<abbr>ft.</abbr> high; he had small, slender legs about 18=C2=A0&lt;=
abbr&gt;in. long, and slight feet of the common lunar pattern. On these=
 balanced a little body, throbbing with the pulsations of his heart. He had=
 long, soft, many-jointed arms ending in a tentacled grip, and his neck was=
 many-jointed in the usual way, but exceptionally short and thick. His head=
, says Cavor=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94apparently alluding to some previous descript=
ion that has gone astray in space=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9Cis of the commo=
n lunar type, but strangely modified. The mouth has the usual expressionles=
s gape, but it is unusually small and pointing downward, and the mask is re=
duced to the size of a large flat nose-flap. On either side are the little =
eyes.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe rest of the head is distended into a huge globe, and the=
 chitinous leathery cuticle of the mooncalf herds thins out to a mere membr=
ane, through which the pulsating brain movements are distinctly visible. He=
 is a creature, indeed, with a tremendously hypertrophied brain, and with t=
he rest of his organism both relatively and absolutely dwarfed.=E2=80=9D
			</p><p>In another passage Cavor compares the back view of him to Atlas suppo=
rting the world. Tsi-puff, it seems, was a very similar insect, but his =E2=
=80=9Cface=E2=80=9D was drawn out to a considerable length, and the brain h=
ypertrophy being in different regions, his head was not round but pear-shap=
ed, with the stalk downward. There were also litter-carriers, lopsided bein=
gs with enormous shoulders, very spidery ushers, and a squat foot attendant=
 in Cavor=E2=80=99s retinue.</p>
			<p>The manner in which Phi-oo and Tsi-puff attacked the problem of speec=
h was fairly obvious. They came into this =E2=80=9Chexagonal cell=E2=80=9D =
in which Cavor was confined, and began imitating every sound he made, begin=
ning with a cough. He seems to have grasped their intention with great quic=
kness, and to have begun repeating words to them and pointing to indicate t=
he application. The procedure was probably always the same. Phi-oo would at=
tend to Cavor for a space, then point also and say the word he had heard.<!--
p-->
			</p><p>The first word he mastered was =E2=80=9Cman,=E2=80=9D and the second =
=E2=80=9CMooney=E2=80=9D=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94which Cavor on the spur of the mo=
ment seems to have used instead of =E2=80=9CSelenite=E2=80=9D for the moon =
race. As soon as Phi-oo was assured of the meaning of a word he repeated it=
 to Tsi-puff, who remembered it infallibly. They mastered over one hundred =
English nouns at their first session.</p>
			<p>Subsequently it seems they brought an artist with them to assist the =
work of explanation with sketches and diagrams=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94Cavor=E2=80=
=99s drawings being rather crude. He was, says Cavor, =E2=80=9Ca being with=
 an active arm and an arresting eye,=E2=80=9D and he seemed to draw with in=
credible swiftness.</p>
			<p>The eleventh message is undoubtedly only a fragment of a longer commu=
nication. After some broken sentences, the record of which is unintelligibl=
e, it goes on:=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut it will interest only linguists, and delay me too long, =
to give the details of the series of intent parleys of which these were the=
 beginning, and, indeed, I very much doubt if I could give in anything like=
 the proper order all the twistings and turnings that we made in our pursui=
t of mutual comprehension. Verbs were soon plain sailing=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a=
t least, such active verbs as I could express by drawings; some adjectives =
were easy, but when it came to abstract nouns, to prepositions, and the sor=
t of hackneyed figures of speech by means of which so much is expressed on =
earth, it was like diving in cork-jackets. Indeed, these difficulties were =
insurmountable until to the sixth lesson came a fourth assistant, a being w=
ith a huge, football-shaped head, whose forte was clearly the pursuit of in=
tricate analogy. He entered in a preoccupied manner, stumbling against a st=
ool, and the difficulties that arose had to be presented to him with a cert=
ain amount of clamour and hitting and pricking before they reached his appr=
ehension. But once he was involved his penetration was amazing. Whenever th=
ere came a need of thinking beyond Phi-oo=E2=80=99s by no means limited sco=
pe, this prolate-headed person was in request, but he invariably told the c=
onclusion to Tsi-puff, in order that it might be remembered; Tsi-puff was e=
ver the arsenal for facts. And so we advanced again.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt seemed long and yet brief=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a matter of da=
ys before I was positively talking with these insects of the moon. Of cours=
e, at first it was an intercourse infinitely tedious and exasperating, but =
imperceptibly it has grown to comprehension. And my patience has grown to m=
eet its limitations. Phi-oo it is who does all the talking. He does it with=

trived to despatch these messages. So far not the slightest attempt has bee=
n made to interfere with me in this, though I have made it quite clear to P=
hi-oo that I am signalling to the earth.</p>

			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd I went on transmitting.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Cavor was continually making corrections in his previous accounts of =
the Selenites as fresh facts flowed in upon him to modify his conclusions, =
and accordingly one gives the quotations that follow with a certain amount =
of reservation. They are quoted from the ninth, thirteenth, and sixteenth m=
essages, and, altogether vague and fragmentary as they are, they probably g=
ive as complete a picture of the social life of this strange community as m=
ankind can now hope to have for many generations.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn the moon,=E2=80=9D says Cavor, =E2=80=9Cevery citizen kno=
ws his place. He is born to that place, and the elaborate discipline of tra=
ining and education and surgery he undergoes fits him at last so completely=
 to it that he has neither ideas nor organs for any purpose beyond it. =E2=
=80=98Why should he?=E2=80=99 Phi-oo would ask. If, for example, a Selenite=
 is destined to be a mathematician, his teachers and trainers set out at on=
ce to that end. They check any incipient disposition to other pursuits, the=
y encourage his mathematical bias with a perfect psychological skill. His b=
rain grows, or at least the mathematical faculties of his brain grow, and t=
he rest of him only so much as is necessary to sustain this essential part =
of him. At last, save for rest and food, his one delight lies in the exerci=
se and display of his faculty, his one interest in its application, his sol=
e society with other specialists in his own line. His brain grows continual=
ly larger, at least so far as the portions engaging in mathematics are conc=
erned; they bulge ever larger and seem to suck all life and vigour from the=
 rest of his frame. His limbs shrivel, his heart and digestive organs dimin=
ish, his insect face is hidden under its bulging contours. His voice become=
s a mere stridulation for the stating of formulae; he seems deaf to all but=
 properly enunciated problems. The faculty of laughter, save for the sudden=
 discovery of some paradox, is lost to him; his deepest emotion is the evol=
ution of a novel computation. And so he attains his end.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9COr, again, a Selenite appointed to be a minder of mooncalves=
 is from his earliest years induced to think and live mooncalf, to find his=
 pleasure in mooncalf lore, his exercise in their tending and pursuit. He i=
s trained to become wiry and active, his eye is indurated to the tight wrap=
pings, the angular contours that constitute a =E2=80=98smart mooncalfishnes=
s.=E2=80=99 He takes at last no interest in the deeper part of the moon; he=
 regards all Selenites not equally versed in mooncalves with indifference, =
derision, or hostility. His thoughts are of mooncalf pastures, and his dial=
ect an accomplished mooncalf technique. So also he loves his work, and disc=
harges in perfect happiness the duty that justifies his being. And so it is=
 with all sorts and conditions of Selenites=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94each is a perf=
ect unit in a world machine.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThese beings with big heads, on whom the intellectual labour=
s fall, form a sort of aristocracy in this strange society, and at the head=
 of them, quintessential of the moon, is that marvellous gigantic ganglion =
the Grand Lunar, into whose presence I am finally to come. The unlimited de=
velopment of the minds of the intellectual class is rendered possible by th=
e absence of any bony skull in the lunar anatomy, that strange box of bone =
that clamps about the developing brain of man, imperiously insisting =E2=80=
=98thus far and no farther=E2=80=99 to all his possibilities. They fall int=
o three main classes differing greatly in influence and respect. There are =
the administrators, of whom Phi-oo is one, Selenites of considerable initia=
tive and versatility, responsible each for a certain cubic content of the m=
oon=E2=80=99s bulk; the experts like the football-headed thinker, who are t=
rained to perform certain special operations; and the erudite, who are the =
repositories of all knowledge. To this latter class belongs Tsi-puff, the f=
irst lunar professor of terrestrial languages. With regard to these latter,=
 it is a curious little thing to note that the unlimited growth of the luna=
r brain has rendered unnecessary the invention of all those mechanical aids=
 to brain work which have distinguished the career of man. There are no boo=
ks, no records of any sort, no libraries or inscriptions. All knowledge is =
stored in distended brains much as the honey-ants of Texas store honey in t=
heir distended abdomens. The lunar Somerset House and the lunar British Mus=
eum Library are collections of living brains.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe less specialised administrators, I note, do for the most=
 part take a very lively interest in me whenever they encounter me. They wi=
ll come out of the way and stare at me and ask questions to which Phi-oo wi=
ll reply. I see them going hither and thither with a retinue of bearers, at=
tendants, shouters, parachute-carriers, and so forth=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94queer=
 groups to see. The experts for the most part ignore me completely, even as=
 they ignore each other, or notice me only to begin a clamorous exhibition =
of their distinctive skill. The erudite for the most part are rapt in an im=
pervious and apoplectic complacency, from which only a denial of their erud=
ition can rouse them. Usually they are led about by little watchers and att=
endants, and often there are small and active-looking creatures, small fema=
les usually, that I am inclined to think are a sort of wife to them; but so=
me of the profounder scholars are altogether too great for locomotion, and =
are carried from place to place in a sort of sedan tub, wabbling jellies of=
 knowledge that enlist my respectful astonishment. I have just passed one i=
n coming to this place where I am permitted to amuse myself with these elec=
trical toys, a vast, shaven, shaky head, bald and thin-skinned, carried on =
his grotesque stretcher. In front and behind came his bearers, and curious,=
 almost trumpet-faced, news disseminators shrieked his fame.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI have already mentioned the retinues that accompany most of=
 the intellectuals: ushers, bearers, valets, extraneous tentacles and muscl=
es, as it were, to replace the abortive physical powers of these hypertroph=
ied minds. Porters almost invariably accompany them. There are also extreme=
ly swift messengers with spider-like legs, and =E2=80=98hands=E2=80=99 for =
grasping parachutes, and attendants with vocal organs that could well-nigh =
wake the dead. Apart from their controlling intelligence these subordinates=
 are as inert and helpless as umbrellas in a stand. They exist only in rela=
tion to the orders they have to obey, the duties they have to perform.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe bulk of these insects, however, who go to and fro upon t=
he spiral ways, who fill the ascending balloons and drop past me clinging t=
o flimsy parachutes, are, I gather, of the operative class. =E2=80=98Machin=
e hands,=E2=80=99 indeed, some of these are in actual nature=E2=81=A0=E2=80=
=94it is no figure of speech, the single tentacle of the mooncalf herd is p=
rofoundly modified for clawing, lifting, guiding, the rest of them no more =
than necessary subordinate appendages to these important parts. Some, who I=
 suppose deal with bell-striking mechanisms, have enormously developed audi=
tory organs; some whose work lies in delicate chemical operations project a=
 vast olfactory organ; others again have flat feet for treadles with anchyl=
osed joints; and others=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94who I have been told are glassblow=
ers=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94seem mere lung-bellows. But every one of these common =
Selenites I have seen at work is exquisitely adapted to the social need it =
meets. Fine work is done by fined-down workers, amazingly dwarfed and neat.=
 Some I could hold on the palm of my hand. There is even a sort of turnspit=
 Selenite, very common, whose duty and only delight it is to supply the mot=
ive power for various small appliances. And to rule over these things and o=
rder any erring tendency there might be in some aberrant natures are the mo=
st muscular beings I have seen in the moon, a sort of lunar police, who mus=
t have been trained from their earliest years to give a perfect respect and=
 obedience to the swollen heads.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe making of these various sorts of operative must be a ver=
y curious and interesting process. I am still very much in the dark about i=
t, but quite recently I came upon a number of young Selenites confined in j=
ars from which only the forelimbs protruded, who were being compressed to b=
ecome machine-minders of a special sort. The extended =E2=80=98hand=E2=80=
=99 in this highly developed system of technical education is stimulated by=
 irritants and nourished by injection, while the rest of the body is starve=
d. Phi-oo, unless I misunderstood him, explained that in the earlier stages=
 these queer little creatures are apt to display signs of suffering in thei=
r various cramped situations, but they easily become indurated to their lot=
; and he took me on to where a number of flexible-limbed messengers were be=
ing drawn out and broken in. It is quite unreasonable, I know, but such gli=
mpses of the educational methods of these beings affect me disagreeably. I =
hope, however, that may pass off, and I may be able to see more of this asp=
ect of their wonderful social order. That wretched-looking hand-tentacle st=
icking out of its jar seemed to have a sort of limp appeal for lost possibi=
lities; it haunts me still, although, of course, it is really in the end a =
far more humane proceeding than our earthly method of leaving children to g=
row into human beings, and then making machines of them.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CQuite recently, too=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I think it was on the e=
leventh or twelfth visit I made to this apparatus=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I had a =
curious light upon the lives of these operatives. I was being guided throug=
h a shortcut hither, instead of going down the spiral and by the quays of t=
he Central Sea. From the devious windings of a long, dark gallery we emerge=
d into a vast, low cavern, pervaded by an earthy smell, and, as things go i=
n this darkness, rather brightly lit. The light came from a tumultuous grow=
th of livid fungoid shapes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94some indeed singularly like our=
 terrestrial mushrooms, but standing as high or higher than a man.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Mooneys eat these?=E2=80=99 said I to Phi-=
oo.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Yes, food.=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Goodness me!=E2=80=99 I cried; =E2=80=98wh=
at=E2=80=99s that?=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy eye had just caught the figure of an exceptionally big an=
d ungainly Selenite lying motionless among the stems, face downward. We sto=
pped.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Dead?=E2=80=99 I asked. (For as yet I have=
 seen no dead in the moon, and I have grown curious.)</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98<em>No!</em>=E2=80=99 exclaimed Phi-oo. =
=E2=80=98Him=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94worker=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94no work to do. Get li=
ttle drink then=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94make sleep=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94till we him wa=
nt. What good him wake, eh? No want him walking about.=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98There=E2=80=99s another!=E2=80=99 cried I.=
</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd indeed all that huge extent of mushroom ground was, I fo=
und, peppered with these prostrate figures sleeping under an opiate until t=
he moon had need of them. There were scores of them of all sorts, and we we=
re able to turn over some of them, and examine them more precisely than I h=
ad been able to do previously. They breathed noisily at my doing so, but di=
d not wake. One I remember very distinctly: he left a strong impression, I =
think, because some trick of the light and of his attitude was strongly sug=
gestive of a drawn-up human figure. His forelimbs were long, delicate tenta=
cles=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94he was some kind of refined manipulator=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94and the pose of his slumber suggested a submissive suffering. No doub=
t it was quite a mistake for me to interpret his expression in that way, bu=
t I did. And as Phi-oo rolled him over into the darkness among the livid fl=
eshiness again I felt a distinctly unpleasant sensation, although as he rol=
led the insect in him was confessed.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt simply illustrates the unthinking way in which one acquir=
es habits of feeling. To drug the worker one does not want and toss him asi=
de is surely far better than to expel him from his factory to wander starvi=
ng in the streets. In every complicated social community there is necessari=
ly a certain intermittency of employment for all specialised labour, and in=
 this way the trouble of an =E2=80=98unemployed=E2=80=99 problem is altoget=
her anticipated. And yet, so unreasonable are even scientifically trained m=
inds, I still do not like the memory of those prostrate forms amidst those =
quiet, luminous arcades of fleshy growth, and I avoid that shortcut in spit=
e of the inconveniences of the longer, more noisy, and more crowded alterna=
tive.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy alternative route takes me round by a huge, shadowy caver=
n, very crowded and clamorous, and here it is I see peering out of the hexa=
gonal openings of a sort of honeycomb wall, or parading a large open space =
behind, or selecting the toys and amulets made to please them by the dainty=
-tentacled jewellers who work in kennels below, the mothers of the moon-wor=
ld=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the queen bees, as it were, of the hive. They are noble=
-looking beings, fantastically and sometimes quite beautifully adorned, wit=
h a proud carriage, and, save for their mouths, almost microscopic heads.<!--
p-->
			</p><p>=E2=80=9COf the condition of the moon sexes, marrying and giving in m=
arriage, and of birth and so forth among the Selenites, I have as yet been =
able to learn very little. With the steady progress of Phi-oo in English, h=
owever, my ignorance will no doubt as steadily disappear. I am of opinion t=
hat, as with the ants and bees, there is a large majority of the members in=
 this community of the neuter sex. Of course on earth in our cities there a=
re now many who never live that life of parentage which is the natural life=
 of man. Here, as with the ants, this thing has become a normal condition o=
f the race, and the whole of such replacement as is necessary falls upon th=
is special and by no means numerous class of matrons, the mothers of the mo=
on-world, large and stately beings beautifully fitted to bear the larval Se=
lenite. Unless I misunderstand an explanation of Phi-oo=E2=80=99s, they are=
 absolutely incapable of cherishing the young they bring into the moon; per=
iods of foolish indulgence alternate with moods of aggressive violence, and=
 as soon as possible the little creatures, who are quite soft and flabby an=
d pale coloured, are transferred to the charge of celibate females, women =
=E2=80=98workers=E2=80=99 as it were, who in some cases possess brains of a=
lmost masculine dimensions.=E2=80=9D</p>

			<p>Just at this point, unhappily, this message broke off. Fragmentary an=
d tantalising as the matter constituting this chapter is, it does neverthel=
ess give a vague, broad impression of an altogether strange and wonderful w=
orld=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a world with which our own may have to reckon we know=
 not how speedily. This intermittent trickle of messages, this whispering o=
f a record needle in the stillness of the mountain slopes, is the first war=
ning of such a change in human conditions as mankind has scarcely imagined =
heretofore. In that satellite of ours there are new elements, new appliance=

			<p>The penultimate message describes, with occasionally even elaborate d=
etail, the encounter between Cavor and the Grand Lunar, who is the ruler or=
 master of the moon. Cavor seems to have sent most of it without interferen=
ce, but to have been interrupted in the concluding portion. The second came=
 after an interval of a week.</p>
			<p>The first message begins: =E2=80=9CAt last I am able to resume this=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D it then becomes illegible for a space, and afte=
r a time resumes in mid-sentence.</p>
			<p>The missing words of the following sentence are probably =E2=80=9Cthe=
 crowd.=E2=80=9D There follows quite clearly: =E2=80=9Cgrew ever denser as =
we drew near the palace of the Grand Lunar=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94if I may call a=
 series of excavations a palace. Everywhere faces stared at me=E2=81=A0=E2=
=80=94blank, chitinous gapes and masks, eyes peering over tremendous olfact=
ory developments, eyes beneath monstrous forehead plates; an undergrowth of=
 smaller creatures dodged and yelped, and helmet faces poised on sinuous, l=
ong-jointed necks appeared craning over shoulders and beneath armpits. Keep=
ing a welcome space about me marched a cordon of stolid, scuttle-headed gua=
rds, who had joined us on our leaving the boat in which we had come along t=
he channels of the Central Sea. The quick-eyed artist with the little brain=
 joined us also, and a thick bunch of lean porter-insects swayed and strugg=
led under the multitude of conveniences that were considered essential to m=
y state. I was carried in a litter during the final stage of our journey. T=
his litter was made of some very ductile metal that looked dark to me, mesh=
ed and woven, and with bars of paler metal, and about me as I advanced ther=
e grouped itself a long and complicated procession.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn front, after the manner of heralds, marched four trumpet-=
faced creatures making a devastating bray; and then came squat, resolute-mo=
ving ushers before and behind, and on either hand a galaxy of learned heads=
, a sort of animated encyclopaedia, who were, Phi-oo explained, to stand ab=
out the Grand Lunar for purposes of reference. (Not a thing in lunar scienc=
e, not a point of view or method of thinking, that these wonderful beings d=
id not carry in their heads!) Followed guards and porters, and then Phi-oo=
=E2=80=99s shivering brain borne also on a litter. Then came Tsi-puff in a =
slightly less important litter; then myself on a litter of greater elegance=
 than any other, and surrounded by my food and drink attendants. More trump=
eters came next, splitting the ear with vehement outcries, and then several=
 big brains, special correspondents one might well call them, or historiogr=
aphers, charged with the task of observing and remembering every detail of =
this epoch-making interview. A company of attendants, bearing and dragging =
banners and masses of scented fungus and curious symbols, vanished in the d=
arkness behind. The way was lined by ushers and officers in caparisons that=
 gleamed like steel, and beyond their line, so far as my eyes could pierce =
the gloom, the heads of that enormous crowd extended.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI will own that I am still by no means indurated to the pecu=
liar effect of the Selenite appearance, and to find myself, as it were, adr=
ift on this broad sea of excited entomology was by no means agreeable. Just=
 for a space I had something very like what I should imagine people mean wh=
en they speak of the =E2=80=98horrors.=E2=80=99 It had come to me before in=
 these lunar caverns, when on occasion I have found myself weaponless and w=
ith an undefended back, amidst a crowd of these Selenites, but never quite =
so vividly. It is, of course, as absolutely irrational a feeling as one cou=
ld well have, and I hope gradually to subdue it. But just for a moment, as =
I swept forward into the welter of the vast crowd, it was only by gripping =
my litter tightly and summoning all my willpower that I succeeded in avoidi=
ng an outcry or some such manifestation. It lasted perhaps three minutes; t=
hen I had myself in hand again.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWe ascended the spiral of a vertical way for some time and t=
hen passed through a series of huge halls, dome-roofed and elaborately deco=
rated. The approach to the Grand Lunar was certainly contrived to give one =
a vivid impression of his greatness. Each cavern one entered seemed greater=
 and more boldly arched than its predecessor. This effect of progressive si=
ze was enhanced by a thin haze of faintly phosphorescent blue incense that =
thickened as one advanced, and robbed even the nearer figures of clearness.=
 I seemed to advance continually to something larger, dimmer, and less mate=
rial.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI must confess that all this multitude made me feel extremel=
y shabby and unworthy. I was unshaven and unkempt; I had brought no razor; =
I had a coarse beard over my mouth. On earth I have always been inclined to=
 despise any attention to my person beyond a proper care for cleanliness; b=
ut under the exceptional circumstances in which I found myself, representin=
g, as I did, my planet and my kind, and depending very largely upon the att=
ractiveness of my appearance for a proper reception, I could have given muc=
h for something a little more artistic and dignified than the husks I wore.=
 I had been so serene in the belief that the moon was uninhabited as to ove=
rlook such precautions altogether. As it was I was dressed in a flannel jac=
ket, knickerbockers, and golfing stockings, stained with every sort of dirt=
 the moon offered; slippers (of which the left heel was wanting), and a bla=
nket, through a hole in which I thrust my head. (These clothes, indeed, I s=
till wear.) Sharp bristles are anything but an improvement to my cast of fe=
atures, and there was an unmended tear at the knee of my knickerbockers tha=
t showed conspicuously as I squatted in my litter; my right stocking, too, =
persisted in getting about my ankle. I am fully alive to the injustice my a=
ppearance did humanity, and if by any expedient I could have improvised som=
ething a little out of the way and imposing I would have done so. But I cou=
ld hit upon nothing. I did what I could with my blanket=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94fo=
lding it somewhat after the fashion of a toga, and for the rest I sat as up=
right as the swaying of my litter permitted.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CImagine the largest hall you have ever been in, imperfectly =
lit with blue light and obscured by a grey-blue fog, surging with metallic =
or livid-grey creatures of such a mad diversity as I have hinted. Imagine t=
his hall to end in an open archway beyond which is a still larger hall, and=
 beyond this yet another and still larger one, and so on. At the end of the=
 vista, dimly seen, a flight of steps, like the steps of Ara C=C5=93li at R=
ome, ascend out of sight. Higher and higher these steps appear to go as one=
 draws nearer their base. But at last I came under a huge archway and behel=
d the summit of these steps, and upon it the Grand Lunar exalted on his thr=
one.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe was seated in what was relatively a blaze of incandescent=
 blue. This, and the darkness about him, gave him an effect of floating in =
a blue-black void. He seemed a small, self-luminous cloud at first, broodin=
g on his sombre throne; his brain case must have measured many yards in dia=
meter. For some reason that I cannot fathom a number of blue searchlights r=
adiated from behind the throne on which he sat, and immediately encircling =
him was a halo. About him, and little and indistinct in this glow, a number=
 of body-servants sustained and supported him, and overshadowed and standin=
g in a huge semicircle beneath him were his intellectual subordinates, his =
remembrancers and computators and searchers and servants, and all the disti=
nguished insects of the court of the moon. Still lower stood ushers and mes=
sengers, and then all down the countless steps of the throne were guards, a=
nd at the base, enormous, various, indistinct, vanishing at last into an ab=
solute black, a vast swaying multitude of the minor dignitaries of the moon=
. Their feet made a perpetual scraping whisper on the rocky floor, their li=
mbs moved with a rustling murmur.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAs I entered the penultimate hall the music rose and expande=
d into an imperial magnificence of sound, and the shrieks of the newsbearer=
s died away.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI entered the last and greatest hall.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy procession opened out like a fan. My ushers and guards we=
nt right and left, and the three litters bearing myself and Phi-oo and Tsi-=
puff marched across a shiny darkness of floor to the foot of the giant stai=
rs. Then began a vast throbbing hum, that mingled with the music. The two S=
elenites dismounted, but I was bidden remain seated=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94I imag=
ine as a special honour. The music ceased, but not that humming, and by a s=
imultaneous movement of ten thousand respectful heads my attention was dire=
cted to the enhaloed supreme intelligence that hovered above me.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAt first as I peered into the radiating glow this quintessen=
tial brain looked very much like an opaque, featureless bladder with dim, u=
ndulating ghosts of convolutions writhing visibly within. Then beneath its =
enormity and just above the edge of the throne one saw with a start minute =
elfin eyes peering out of the glow. No face, but eyes, as if they peered th=
rough holes. At first I could see no more than these two staring little eye=
s, and then below I distinguished the little dwarfed body and its insect-jo=
inted limbs shrivelled and white. The eyes stared down at me with a strange=
 intensity, and the lower part of the swollen globe was wrinkled. Ineffectu=
al-looking little hand-tentacles steadied this shape on the throne.=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIt was great. It was pitiful. One forgot the hall and the cr=
owd.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI ascended the staircase by jerks. It seemed to me that this=
 darkly glowing brain case above us spread over me, and took more and more =
of the whole effect into itself as I drew nearer. The tiers of attendants a=
nd helpers grouped about their master seemed to dwindle and fade into the n=
ight. I saw that shadowy attendants were busy spraying that great brain wit=
h a cooling spray, and patting and sustaining it. For my own part, I sat gr=
ipping my swaying litter and staring at the Grand Lunar, unable to turn my =
gaze aside. And at last, as I reached a little landing that was separated o=
nly by ten steps or so from the supreme seat, the woven splendour of the mu=
sic reached a climax and ceased, and I was left naked, as it were, in that =
vastness, beneath the still scrutiny of the Grand Lunar=E2=80=99s eyes.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe was scrutinising the first man he had ever seen.=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CMy eyes dropped at last from his greatness to the faint figu=
res in the blue mist about him, and then down the steps to the massed Selen=
ites, still and expectant in their thousands, packed on the floor below. On=
ce again an unreasonable horror reached out towards me.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 And passed.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAfter the pause came the salutation. I was assisted from my =
litter, and stood awkwardly while a number of curious and no doubt deeply s=
ymbolical gestures were vicariously performed for me by two slender officia=
ls. The encyclopaedic galaxy of the learned that had accompanied me to the =
entrance of the last hall appeared two steps above me and left and right of=
 me, in readiness for the Grand Lunar=E2=80=99s need, and Phi-oo=E2=80=99s =
pale brain placed itself about halfway up to the throne in such a position =
as to communicate easily between us without turning his back on either the =
Grand Lunar or myself. Tsi-puff took up a position behind him. Dexterous us=
hers sidled sideways towards me, keeping a full face to the Presence. I sea=
ted myself Turkish fashion, and Phi-oo and Tsi-puff also knelt down above m=
e. There came a pause. The eyes of the nearer court went from me to the Gra=
nd Lunar and came back to me, and a hissing and piping of expectation passe=
d across the hidden multitudes below and ceased.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThat humming ceased.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CFor the first and last time in my experience the moon was si=
lent.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI became aware of a faint wheezy noise. The Grand Lunar was =
addressing me. It was like the rubbing of a finger upon a pane of glass.
			</p><p>=E2=80=9CI watched him attentively for a time, and then glanced at th=
e alert Phi-oo. I felt amidst these slender beings ridiculously thick and f=
leshy and solid; my head all jaw and black hair. My eyes went back to the G=
rand Lunar. He had ceased; his attendants were busy, and his shining superf=
icies was glistening and running with cooling spray.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CPhi-oo meditated through an interval. He consulted Tsi-puff.=
 Then he began piping his recognisable English=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94at first a =
little nervously, so that he was not very clear.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98M=E2=80=99m=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94the Grand Lun=

=80=94the state of your world, and the reason why you came to this.=E2=80=
=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe paused. I was about to reply when he resumed. He proceede=
d to remarks of which the drift was not very clear, though I am inclined to=
 think they were intended to be complimentary. He told me that the earth wa=
s to the moon what the sun is to the earth, and that the Selenites desired =
very greatly to learn about the earth and men. He then told me, no doubt in=
 compliment also, the relative magnitude and diameter of earth and moon, an=
d the perpetual wonder and speculation with which the Selenites had regarde=
d our planet. I meditated with downcast eyes, and decided to reply that men=
 too had wondered what might lie in the moon, and had judged it dead, littl=
e recking of such magnificence as I had seen that day. The Grand Lunar, in =
token of recognition, caused his long blue rays to rotate in a very confusi=
ng manner, and all about the great hall ran the pipings and whisperings and=
 rustlings of the report of what I had said. He then proceeded to put to Ph=
i-oo a number of inquiries which were easier to answer.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe understood, he explained, that we lived on the surface of=
 the earth, that our air and sea were outside the globe; the latter part, i=
ndeed, he already knew from his astronomical specialists. He was very anxio=
us to have more detailed information of what he called this extraordinary s=
tate of affairs, for from the solidity of the earth there had always been a=
 disposition to regard it as uninhabitable. He endeavoured first to ascerta=
in the extremes of temperature to which we earth beings were exposed, and h=
e was deeply interested by my descriptive treatment of clouds and rain. His=
 imagination was assisted by the fact that the lunar atmosphere in the oute=
r galleries of the night side is not infrequently very foggy. He seemed inc=
lined to marvel that we did not find the sunlight too intense for our eyes,=
 and was interested in my attempt to explain that the sky was tempered to a=
 bluish colour through the refraction of the air, though I doubt if he clea=
rly understood that. I explained how the iris of the human eyes can contrac=
t the pupil and save the delicate internal structure from the excess of sun=
light, and was allowed to approach within a few feet of the Presence in ord=
er that this structure might be seen. This led to a comparison of the lunar=
 and terrestrial eyes. The former is not only excessively sensitive to such=
 light as men can see, but it can also <em>see</em> heat, and every differe=
nce in temperature within the moon renders objects visible to it.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe iris was quite a new organ to the Grand Lunar. For a tim=
e he amused himself by flashing his rays into my face and watching my pupil=
s contract. As a consequence, I was dazzled and blinded for some little tim=
e.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CBut in spite of that discomfort I found something reassuring=
 by insensible degrees in the rationality of this business of question and =
answer. I could shut my eyes, think of my answer, and almost forget that th=
e Grand Lunar has no face.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhen I had descended again to my proper place the Grand Luna=
r asked how we sheltered ourselves from heat and storms, and I expounded to=
 him the arts of building and furnishing. Here we wandered into misundersta=
ndings and cross-purposes, due largely, I must admit, to the looseness of m=
y expressions. For a long time I had great difficulty in making him underst=
and the nature of a house. To him and his attendant Selenites it seemed, no=
 doubt, the most whimsical thing in the world that men should build houses =
when they might descend into excavations, and an additional complication wa=
s introduced by the attempt I made to explain that men had originally begun=
 their homes in caves, and that they were now taking their railways and man=
y establishments beneath the surface. Here I think a desire for intellectua=
l completeness betrayed me. There was also a considerable tangle due to an =
equally unwise attempt on my part to explain about mines. Dismissing this t=
opic at last in an incomplete state, the Grand Lunar inquired what we did w=
ith the interior of our globe.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CA tide of twittering and piping swept into the remotest corn=
ers of that great assembly when it was at last made clear that we men know =
absolutely nothing of the contents of the world upon which the immemorial g=
enerations of our ancestors had been evolved. Three times had I to repeat t=
hat of all the 4000 miles of substance between the earth and its centre men=
 knew only to the depth of a mile, and that very vaguely. I understood the =
Grand Lunar to ask why had I come to the moon seeing we had scarcely touche=
d our own planet yet, but he did not trouble me at that time to proceed to =
an explanation, being too anxious to pursue the details of this mad inversi=
on of all his ideas.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe reverted to the question of weather, and I tried to descr=
ibe the perpetually changing sky, and snow, and frost, and hurricanes. =E2=
=80=98But when the night comes,=E2=80=99 he asked, =E2=80=98is it not cold?=
=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI told him it was colder than by day.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98And does not your atmosphere freeze?=E2=80=
=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI told him not; that it was never cold enough for that, beca=
use our nights were so short.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Not even liquefy?=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI was about to say =E2=80=98No,=E2=80=99 but then it occurre=
d to me that one part at least of our atmosphere, the water vapour of it, d=
oes sometimes liquefy and form dew, and sometimes freeze and form frost=E2=
=81=A0=E2=80=94a process perfectly analogous to the freezing of all the ext=
ernal atmosphere of the moon during its longer night. I made myself clear o=
n this point, and from that the Grand Lunar went on to speak with me of sle=
ep. For the need of sleep that comes so regularly every twenty-four hours t=
o all things is part also of our earthly inheritance. On the moon they rest=
 only at rare intervals, and after exceptional exertions. Then I tried to d=
escribe to him the soft splendours of a summer night, and from that I passe=
d to a description of those animals that prowl by night and sleep by day. I=
 told him of lions and tigers, and here it seemed as though we had come to =
a deadlock. For, save in their waters, there are no creatures in the moon n=
ot absolutely domestic and subject to his will, and so it has been for imme=
morial years. They have monstrous water creatures, but no evil beasts, and =
the idea of anything strong and large existing =E2=80=98outside=E2=80=99 in=
 the night is very difficult for them.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6=
=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>[The record is here too broken to transcribe for the space of perhaps=
 twenty words or more.]</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe talked with his attendants, as I suppose, upon the strang=
e superficiality and unreasonableness of (man), who lives on the mere surfa=
ce of a world, a creature of waves and winds, and all the chances of space,=
 who cannot even unite to overcome the beasts that prey upon his kind, and =
yet who dares to invade another planet. During this aside I sat thinking, a=
nd then at his desire I told him of the different sorts of men. He searched=
 me with questions. =E2=80=98And for all sorts of work you have the same so=
rt of men. But who thinks? Who governs?=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI gave him an outline of the democratic method.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CWhen I had done he ordered cooling sprays upon his brow, and=
 then requested me to repeat my explanation, conceiving something had misca=
rried.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Do they not do different things, then?=E2=
=80=99 said Phi-oo.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CSome I admitted were thinkers and some officials; some hunte=
d, some were mechanics, some artists, some toilers. =E2=80=98But <em>all rule,=E2=80=99 I said.</em></p><em>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98And have they not different shapes to fit =
them to their different duties?=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98None that you can see,=E2=80=99 I said, =
=E2=80=98except, perhaps, for clothes. Their minds perhaps differ a little,=
=E2=80=99 I reflected.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Their minds must differ a great deal,=E2=
=80=99 said the Grand Lunar, =E2=80=98or they would all want to do the same=
 things.=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CIn order to bring myself into a closer harmony with his prec=
onceptions I said that his surmise was right. =E2=80=98It was all hidden in=
 the brain,=E2=80=99 I said; =E2=80=98but the difference was there. Perhaps=
 if one could see the minds and souls of men they would be as varied and un=
equal as the Selenites. There were great men and small men, men who could r=
each out far and wide, and men who could go swiftly; noisy, trumpet-minded =
men, and men who could remember without thinking.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=A6 [The record is indistinct for three words.]</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe interrupted me to recall me to my previous statement. =E2=
=80=98But you said all men rule?=E2=80=99 he pressed.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98To a certain extent,=E2=80=99 I said, and =
made, I fear, a denser fog with my explanation.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe reached out to a salient fact. =E2=80=98Do you mean,=E2=
=80=99 he asked, =E2=80=98that there is no Grand Earthly?=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI thought of several people, but assured him finally there w=
as none. I explained that such autocrats and emperors as we had tried upon =
earth had usually ended in drink, or vice, or violence, and that the large =
and influential section of the people of the earth to which I belonged, the=
 Anglo-Saxons, did not mean to try that sort of thing again. At which the G=
rand Lunar was even more amazed.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98But how do you keep even such wisdom as yo=
u have?=E2=80=99 he asked; and I explained to him the way we helped our lim=
ited [a word omitted here, probably =E2=80=9Cbrains=E2=80=9D] with librarie=
s of books. I explained to him how our science was growing by the united la=
bours of innumerable little men, and on that he made no comment save that i=
t was evident we had mastered much in spite of our social savagery, or we c=
ould not have come to the moon. Yet the contrast was very marked. With know=
ledge the Selenites grew and changed; mankind stored their knowledge about =
them and remained brutes=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94equipped. He said this=E2=81=A0=
=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 [Here there is a short piece of the record indi=
stinct.]</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe then caused me to describe how we went about this earth o=
f ours, and I described to him our railways and ships. For a time he could =
not understand that we had had the use of steam only one hundred years, but=
 when he did he was clearly amazed. (I may mention as a singular thing that=
 the Selenites use years to count by, just as we do on earth, though I can =
make nothing of their numeral system. That, however, does not matter, becau=
se Phi-oo understands ours.) From that I went on to tell him that mankind h=
ad dwelt in cities only for nine or ten thousand years, and that we were st=
ill not united in one brotherhood, but under many different forms of govern=
ment. This astonished the Grand Lunar very much, when it was made clear to =
him. At first he thought we referred merely to administrative areas.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98Our States and Empires are still the rawes=
t sketches of what order will some day be,=E2=80=99 I said, and so I came t=
o tell him.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6 [At this point a length of =
record that probably represents thirty or forty words is totally illegible.=
]</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CThe Grand Lunar was greatly impressed by the folly of men in=
 clinging to the inconvenience of diverse tongues. =E2=80=98They want to co=
mmunicate, and yet not to communicate,=E2=80=99 he said, and then for a lon=
g time he questioned me closely concerning war.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe was at first perplexed and incredulous. =E2=80=98You mean=
 to say,=E2=80=99 he asked, seeking confirmation, =E2=80=98that you run abo=
ut over the surface of your world=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94this world, whose riches=
 you have scarcely begun to scrape=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94killing one another for=
 beasts to eat?=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI told him that was perfectly correct.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CHe asked for particulars to assist his imagination. =E2=80=
=98But do not ships and your poor little cities get injured?=E2=80=99 he as=
ked, and I found the waste of property and conveniences seemed to impress h=
im almost as much as the killing. =E2=80=98Tell me more,=E2=80=99 said the =
Grand Lunar; =E2=80=98make me see pictures. I cannot conceive these things.=
=E2=80=99</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CAnd so, for a space, though something loth, I told him the s=
tory of earthly War.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI told him of the first orders and ceremonies of war, of war=
nings and ultimatums, and the marshalling and marching of troops. I gave hi=
m an idea of manoeuvres and positions and battle joined. I told him of sieg=
es and assaults, of starvation and hardship in trenches, and of sentinels f=
reezing in the snow. I told him of routs and surprises, and desperate last =
stands and faint hopes, and the pitiless pursuit of fugitives and the dead =
upon the field. I told, too, of the past, of invasions and massacres, of th=
e Huns and Tartars, and the wars of Muhammad and the Caliphs, and of the Cr=
usades. And as I went on, and Phi-oo translated, the Selenites cooed and mu=
rmured in a steadily intensified emotion.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI told them an ironclad could fire a shot of a ton twelve mi=
les, and go through 20=C2=A0<abbr>ft.</abbr> of iron=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94and h=
ow we could steer torpedoes under water. I went on to describe a Maxim gun =
in action, and what I could imagine of the Battle of Colenso. The Grand Lun=
ar was so incredulous that he interrupted the translation of what I had sai=
d in order to have my verification of my account. They particularly doubted=
 my description of the men cheering and rejoicing as they went into (? batt=
le).</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98But surely they do not like it!=E2=80=99 t=
ranslated Phi-oo.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9CI assured them men of my race considered battle the most glo=
rious experience of life, at which the whole assembly was stricken with ama=
zement.</p>
			<p>=E2=80=9C=E2=80=8A=E2=80=98But what good is this war?=E2=80=99 asked =
the Grand Lunar, sticking to his theme.</p>

				<p>At this point a series of undulations that have been apparent as a p=
erplexing complication as far back as Cavor=E2=80=99s description of the si=
lence that fell before the first speaking of the Grand Lunar become confusi=
ngly predominant in the record. These undulations are evidently the result =
of radiations proceeding from a lunar source, and their persistent approxim=
ation to the alternating signals of Cavor is curiously suggestive of some o=
perator deliberately seeking to mix them in with his message and render it =
illegible. At first they are small and regular, so that with a little care =
and the loss of very few words we have been able to disentangle Cavor=E2=80=
=99s message; then they become broad and larger, then suddenly they are irr=
egular, with an irregularity that gives the effect at last of someone scrib=
bling through a line of writing. For a long time nothing can be made of thi=
s madly zigzagging trace; then quite abruptly the interruption ceases, leav=
es a few words clear, and then resumes and continues for all the rest of th=
e message, completely obliterating whatever Cavor was attempting to transmi=
t. Why, if this is indeed a deliberate intervention, the Selenites should h=
ave preferred to let Cavor go on transmitting his message in happy ignoranc=
e of their obliteration of its record, when it was clearly quite in their p=
ower and much more easy and convenient for them to stop his proceedings at =
any time, is a problem to which I can contribute nothing. The thing seems t=
o have happened so, and that is all I can say. This last rag of his descrip=
tion of the Grand Lunar begins in mid-sentence:=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94</p>

				<p epub:type="3D&quot;title&quot;">The Last Message Cavor Sent to the Earth</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>In this unsatisfactory manner the penultimate message of Cavor dies o=
ut. One seems to see him away there in the blue obscurity amidst his appara=
tus intently signalling us to the last, all unaware of the curtain of confu=
sion that drops between us; all unaware, too, of the final dangers that eve=
n then must have been creeping upon him. His disastrous want of vulgar comm=
on sense had utterly betrayed him. He had talked of war, he had talked of a=
ll the strength and irrational violence of men, of their insatiable aggress=
ions, their tireless futility of conflict. He had filled the whole moon wor=
ld with this impression of our race, and then I think it is plain that he m=
ade the most fatal admission that upon himself alone hung the possibility=
=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94at least for a long time=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94of any further =
men reaching the moon. The line the cold, inhuman reason of the moon would =
take seems plain enough to me, and a suspicion of it, and then perhaps some=
 sudden sharp realisation of it, must have come to him. One imagines him go=
ing about the moon with the remorse of this fatal indiscretion growing in h=
is mind. During a certain time I am inclined to guess the Grand Lunar was d=
eliberating the new situation, and for all that time Cavor may have gone as=
 free as ever he had gone. But obstacles of some sort prevented his getting=
 to his electromagnetic apparatus again after that message I have just give=
n. For some days we received nothing. Perhaps he was having fresh audiences=
, and trying to evade his previous admissions. Who can hope to guess?</p>
			<p>And then suddenly, like a cry in the night, like a cry that is follow=
ed by a stillness, came the last message. It is the briefest fragment, the =
broken beginnings of two sentences.</p>
			<p>The first was: =E2=80=9CI was mad to let the Grand Lunar know=E2=81=
=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>There was an interval of perhaps a minute. One imagines some interrup=
tion from without. A departure from the instrument=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a dread=
ful hesitation among the looming masses of apparatus in that dim, blue-lit =
cavern=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94a sudden rush back to it, full of a resolve that ca=
me too late. Then, as if it were hastily transmitted, came: =E2=80=9CCavori=
te made as follows: take=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>There followed one word, a quite unmeaning word as it stands: =E2=80=
=9Culess.=E2=80=9D</p>
			<p>And that is all.</p>
			<p>It may be he made a hasty attempt to spell =E2=80=9Cuseless=E2=80=9D =
when his fate was close upon him. Whatever it was that was happening about =
that apparatus we cannot tell. Whatever it was we shall never, I know, rece=
ive another message from the moon. For my own part a vivid dream has come t=
o my help, and I see, almost as plainly as though I had seen it in actual f=
act, a blue-lit shadowy dishevelled Cavor struggling in the grip of these i=
nsect Selenites, struggling ever more desperately and hopelessly as they pr=
ess upon him, shouting, expostulating, perhaps even at last fighting, and b=
eing forced backward step by step out of all speech or sign of his fellows,=
 for evermore into the Unknown=E2=81=A0=E2=80=94into the dark, into that si=
lence that has no end.=E2=81=A0=E2=80=8A=E2=81=A0=E2=80=A6</p>
